# Tools {.unnumbered #part-T}

This part provides practical guidance for using all the algorithms featured in JDemetra+, be it with the [Graphical User Interface](#t-gui-overview) or [R packages](#t-r-packs). Further methodological insights on each algorithm can be found in the [Methods](#part-M) part of this book, whereas detailed description of all the available tools allowing to access the algorithms can be found in the [Tools](#part-M) part.

The different tools described in this part:

-   Graphical User Interface [GUI](T-graphical-user-interface.qmd)

-   ...enhanced with additional [plug-ins](T-plug-ins.qmd)

-   ..and a [Cruncher](T-Production-tools-cruncher-QR.qmd) for mass production

-   [R packages](T-r-packages.qmd)
