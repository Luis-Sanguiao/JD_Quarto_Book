The X-11 method considers monthly and quarterly series while SEATS is able to decompose series with 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12 observations per year.\n\n\n3.1.2 X-13\nX-13ARIMA is a seasonal adjustment program developed and supported by the U.S. Census Bureau. It is based on the U.S. Census Bureau's earlier X-11 program, the X-11-ARIMA program developed at Statistics Canada, the X-12-ARIMA program developed by the U.S. Census Bureau, and the SEATS program developed at the Banco de España. The program is now used by the U.S. Census Bureau for a seasonal adjustment of time series.\n\n\n3.1.3 Tramo-Seats\n\n\n3.1.4 STL\n\n\n3.1.5 Basic Structural Models"
