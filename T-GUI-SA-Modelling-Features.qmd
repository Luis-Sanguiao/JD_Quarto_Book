# GUI: SA and Modelling Features {.unnumbered #t-gui-sa}

## In this chapter

This chapter covers specific Seasonal Adjustment and Modelling features. Modelling refers to reg-Arima or Tramo when used stand alone and not as the first (pre-adjustment) step in seasonal adjustment. Note that the menu and window structure as well as options and results are almost identical in both cases.


Additional chapters related to GUI features, provide information on:

- [Overview](#t-gui-overview)
- [Data visualization and generic time series tools](#t-GUI-tstools)
- [Output: series, parameters and diagnostics](#t-gui-output)

Currently, this chapter is widely incomplete, additional content will be uploaded in the coming weeks.

## Workspace Window

The workspace window displays the characteristics of a workspace but gives also access to other peripheric routines, the results of which won't be stored in a workspace (as data structure)

Content of *Workspace* window, divided into three sections:

-   [Modelling](#modelling-window) (contains the default and user-defined specifications for modelling; and the output from the modelling process)

-   [Seasonal adjustment](#sa-window) (contains the default and user-defined specifications for seasonal adjustment and the output from the seasonal adjustment process),

-   Utilities ([calendars](#usr-def-cal) and [user defined variables](#usr-def-var)).

### Modelling {#modelling-window}

When using reg-Arima or Tramo stand alone.

This section is divided into two parts: 

- Specifications: parameters of the modelling procedure.

- Output

### Seasonal adjustment {#sa-window}

This window allows to set up and launch a [seasonal adjustment process](#sa-overview).

This section is divided into two parts:

* [Specifications](#pre-pro-spec), which presents parameters of the seasonal adjustment procedure.
* [Output](#results-panel), which explains a typical output produced by the seasonal adjustment procedure.

The specifications and output for the seasonal adjustment procedure are displayed in the *Workspace* window under the *Seasonal adjustment* item.

### Results panel {#results-panel}


The blank zone in the figure above (on the right of the view) is the location where JDemetra+ displays various windows. More than one window can be displayed at the same time. Windows can overlap with each other with the foremost window being the one in focus or active. The active window has a darkened title bar. [The windows in the results panel can be arranged in many different ways](#window-menu), depending on the user's needs. The example below shows one of the possible views of this panel. The results of the user's analysis are displayed in an accompanying window. The picture below shows two panels -- a window containing seasonal adjustment results (upper panel) and another one containing an autoregressive spectrum (lower panel).

## Statistical Methods Menu {#statistical-methods}

-   [Anomaly Detection](#anomaly-detection) -- allows for a purely automatic identification of regression effects;

![**The *Anomaly detection* tab.**](All_images/Statistical methods menu anomaly detection.png)

-   [Modelling](#modelling) -- enables time series modelling using the TRAMO and RegARIMA models;

![**The *Modelling* tab.**](All_images/Statistical methods menu modelling.png)

-   [Seasonal adjustment](#seasonal-adjustment) -- intended for the seasonal adjustment of a time series with the TRAMO-SEATS and X-13ARIMA-SEATS methods.

![**The *Seasonal adjustment* tab.**](All_images/Statistical methods menu.jpg)
-   [Tools](#seasonal-adjustment) -- provides access to seasonality tests, described [here](#t-GUI-tstools-tests) and to Direct-Indirect Seasonal adjustment tools (up coming content)
