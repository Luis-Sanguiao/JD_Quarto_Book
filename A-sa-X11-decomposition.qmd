# SA: X-11 Decomposition {.unnumbered}

## Context of use

-   seasonal adjustment with X-13-Arima second step

-   stand alone X-11 decomposition classical data

-   extended X11 for any frequency data (differences in access: no GUI, display and user-friendliness)

## Tools for X-11 decomposition

| Algorithm              | Access in GUI | Access in R (v2) | Access in R v3 |
|------------------------|---------------|------------------|----------------|
| X-13 Arima             | yes           | RJDemetra        | rjd3x13        |
| X11 decomposition only | yes           | RJDemetra        | rjd3x13        |
| Extended X11           | no            | no               | rjd3x11plus    |

## X-11 Decomposition

Here main module, not extended Extended in HF Chapter (see this...)

This part explains how to use X-11 decomposition algorithm, via R as well as via GUI. The algorithm itself is explained in more details [here](M-X11-decomposition.qmd)

In a SA, X-11 will de decompose the **linearized series** using iteratively different moving averages. The effects of pre-treatment will be reallocated at the end (link). If not pre-treament is used (option=), x11 xill decompose teh raw series.

### Default specifications{#default_specs}

The default specifications for X-11 must be chosen at the starting of the SA processing.

Even if only x11

They are detailed in the [Reg-Arima part](A-sa.qmd#Pre-treatment:%20Reg-ARIMA%20(or%20Tramo)). X-11 can be run without pre-treatment

### Quick Launch

Maybe cut this
- if part of SA detailed "above" 
- if x11 only detail here 

#### From GUI

With a workspace open, an SAProcessing created and open data provider:
(link to GUI genral process) + quick start
-   choose a default specification

-   drop your data and press green arrow

#### In R

In version 2

```{r,eval=FALSE}

library("RJDemetra")
model_sa_v2 <- x13(raw_series, spec ="RSA5c")

```

The model_sa_2 R object (list of lists) contains all parameters and results. Its structure is detailed here (R packages chapter, rjdemetra).

In version 3

```{r,eval=FALSE}

library("rjd3toolkit")
library("rjd3x13")
model_sa_v3 <- rjd3x13::x13(y_raw, spec = "RSA5")

```

The model_sa_3 R object (list of lists) contains all parameters and results. Its structure is detailed here (R packages chapter, rjd3x13).


### Retrieve series

#### Display in GUI

Final components from the SA Process are displayed in Main results (link to gui chapter) Panel
They contain the re-allocated pre-adjustment effects (link) of outliers (link) or external regressors (link).

![](All_images/SA_MainResults_Series.png)

(forecasts are added at the end of the ser, values in *italic*)

Detailed results from decomposition are displayed in Decomposition(X-11) node
(link to output tables detail here)

![](All_images/RDimage41.png)

They contain the re-allocated pre-adjustment effects (link) of outliers (link) or external regressors (link)

specifically (write formulas)
- D12...

Output series can be exported out of GUI by two means:

-   generating [output files directly with interactive menus (T-GUI-Output.qmd)

-   running the cruncher to generate those files as described [here](T-Production-tools-cruncher-QR.qmd)

#### Retrieve in R

In version 2

```{r,eval=FALSE}

# final components
model_sa$final$series
# final forecasts y_f sa_f s_f t_f i_f
model_sa$final$forecasts
# from user defined output 
```

Detailed X-11 tables have to be pre-specified by the user in user defined output.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# from user defined output 
```



In version 3

```{r,eval=FALSE}

# final components
model_sa$final$series
# final forecasts y_f sa_f s_f t_f i_f
model_sa$final$forecasts
# from user defined output 
```

```

#### M-statistics

X-11 algorithm provides quality measures of the decomposition called "M statistics" (detailed [here](M-X11-decomposition-M)

- 11 statistics (M1 to M11)

- 2 summary indicators (Q et Q-M2)

- by design $0<M_x<3$ and acceptance region is $M_x \leq 1$


##### Display in GUI

To display results in GUI, expand NODE

Decomposition(X-11) \> Quality Measures \> Summary

Results displayed in red indicate that the test failed.

They are detailed in the [X-11 method chapter](M-X11-decomposition.qmd)

In R (to be added): not directly available ?!

### Retrieve final filters

The following parameters are automatically chosen by the software as a result of the estimation process. They have no default value but can be set by the user.

- **Final trend filter**: length of Henderson filter applied for final trend estimation (in the second part of the D step).

- **Final seasonal filer**: length of final seasonal filter for seasonal component estimation (in the second part of the D step).

#### Retrieve in R

In version 2

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library("RJDemetra")
model_sa_v2 <- x13(raw_seriesa, spec ="RSA5c")
model_sa$decomposition$s_filter
model_sa$decomposition$t_filter
```
In version 3
```{r,eval=FALSE}

model_sa_v3$result$decomposition$final_seasonal
model_sa_v3$result$decomposition$final_henderson
```

### User-defined parameters

The following parameters have default values, which will not be changed in the estimation process. They can be set by the user ina given range of admissible values.

##### General settings

-   **Mode**

    - Undefined: autoimatically chosen between Multiplicative and Additive
Options available only if no pre-processing:
    - Additive: $Y=T+S+I$
    - Multiplicative $Y=T*S*I$ 
    - LogAdditive
    - PseudoAdditive


If X11 decomposition comes after a pre-processing, **mode** is set to undefined and will correspond to decomposition choice (link) made in the pre-treatment: multiplicative if series log- transformed, additive otherwise.

-   **Seasonal component**

Option available only if no pre-processing:
    - yes (default), decomposition into $S$, $T$, $I$
    - no, decomposition into $S$, $T$, $I$
    
-   **Forecasts horizon**

Length of the forecasts generated by the Reg-Arima model - in months (positive values) - years (negative values) - if set to is set to 0, the X-11 procedure does not use any model-based forecasts but the original X-11 type forecasts for one year. - default value: -1, thus one year from the Arima model

-   **Backcasts horizon**

Length of the backcasts generated by the Reg-Arima model - in months (positive values) - years (negative values) - default value: 0

##### Irregular correction

-   **LSigma**
    -   sets lower sigma (standard deviation) limit used to down-weight the extreme irregular values in the internal seasonal adjustment iterations
    -   values in $[0,Usigma]$
    -   default value is 1.5

-   **USigma**
    -   sets upper sigma (standard deviation)
    -   values in $[Lsigma,+\infty]$
    -   default value is 2.5

-   **Calendarsigma**

Allows to set different **LSigma** and **USigma** for each period
        -   None (default)
        -   All: standard errors used for the extreme values detection and adjustment computed separately for each calendar month/quarter
        -   Signif: groups determined by Cochran test (check)
        -   Sigmavec: set two customized groups of periods

-   **Excludeforecasts**

    -   ticked: forecasts and backcasts from the Reg-Arima model not used in Irregular Correction
    -   unticked (default): forecasts and backcasts used

##### Seasonality extraction filters choice

-   **Seasonal filter**

Specifies which filters will be used to estimate the seasonal factors for the entire series.

-   default value: *MSR* [Moving seasonality ratio](M-X11-decomposition.qmd), automatic choice of final seasonal filter, initial filters are $3\times 3$

-   choices: $3\times 1$, $3\times 3$, $3\times 5$, $3\times 9$, $3\times 15$ or Stable

-   "Stable": constant factor for each calendar period (simple moving average of a all $S+I$ values for each period)

User choices will be applied to final phase D step.

The seasonal filters can be selected for the entire series, or for a particular month or quarter.

-   **Details on seasonal filters**

Sets different seasonal filters by period in order to account for [seasonal heteroskedasticity](M-X11-decomposition.qmd)

-   default value: empty, same filter for all periods

##### Trend estimation filters

-   **Automatic Henderson filter** or user-defined

    -   default: length 13
    -   unticked: user-defined length choice

-   **Henderson filter** length choice

    -   values: odd number in $[3,101]$
    -   default value: 13

Check: will user choice be applied to all steps or only to final phase D step

#### Parameter setting in GUI

All the parameters above can be set with in the [specification box](T-GUI-SA-Modelling-Features.qmd)
