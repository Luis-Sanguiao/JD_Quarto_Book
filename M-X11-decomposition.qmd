## Moving averages

### Definitions

A moving average of *order* $p+f+1$ and coefficients $(\theta_i)$ is the operator $M$ defined as:
$$
MX_t = \sum_{i=-p}^{f}\theta_i X_{t+i}
$$

The series value in $t$ is replaced by a weighted average of $p$ past values, the current value and the $f$ future values. If $p=f$, the moving average is *centered* and if $\theta_{-i} = \theta_i$, it is *symmetrical*.


Example of simple moving average of order 3:

$$
MX_t = \frac{1}{3}(X_{t-1}+X_{t}+ X_{t+1})
$$

A moving average is a **linear operator**, $M(X_t+Y_t) = M(X_t)+M(Y_t)$.

### Combined moving averages

Centred and symmetrical moving averages preserve linear trends, which is a desirable propriety. They cannot have an even order, thus for even orders they are obtained by combining simple moving averages as arithmetic means of p moving averages of the same order (ie. length): $M_{p\times order}$

Combination example for order 12:

There are two intuitive ways to create a Moving Average of order 12:

$$
M1X_t = \frac{1}{12}(X_{t-6}+X_{t-5}+ X_{t-4}+ X_{t-3}+ X_{t-2}+ X_{t-1}
$$
$$
+ X_{t}+ X_{t+1}+ X_{t+2}+ X_{t+3}+ X_{t+4}+X_{t+5})
$$
The other being:
$$
M2X_t = \frac{1}{12}(X_{t-5}+ X_{t-4}+ X_{t-3}+ X_{t-2}+ X_{t-1}+ X_{t}
$$
$$
+ X_{t+1}+ X_{t+2}+ X_{t+3}+ X_{t+4}+X_{t+5}+X_{t+6})
$$

A centred and symmetrical MA with an **even order** (here 12) can be created:

$$
M_{2\times 12}= \frac{1}{2}(M1X_t+M2X_t)
$$
which is: 

$$
M_{2\times 12} =\frac{1}{24}(X_{t-6}) +\frac{1}{12}(X_{t-5}+ X_{t-4}
$$
$$
+X_{t-3}+ X_{t-2}+ X_{t-1}+ X_{t}+X_{t+1}+ X_{t+2}
$$
$$
+ X_{t+3}+ X_{t+4}+X_{t+5})+\frac{1}{24}(X_{t+6})
$$


### Supressing locally constant seasonality 

Applying a moving average of an order equal to the periodicity of the raw series removes a locally stable seasonality ($\sum_{i=1}^{12}S_{t+i} = 0$)

A moving average of order, 12 will remove a locally stable monthly seasonality: $M_{1\times 12}(S)=0$ and also $M_{2\times 12}(S)=0$ with linear trend preservation.


## X-11 algorithm steps {#X-11-steps}

The X-11 decomposition algorithm has eight main steps, outlined below for a monthly time series. (For a quarterly time series a $2\times 4$
moving average would be used, instead of $2\times 12$)


Step 1: Estimation of the **trend-cycle** with a $2\times 12$ MA
$$
TC_t^{(1)}=M_{2\times 12}(X_t)
$$

Step 2: Estimation of the **seasonal+irregular** component
$$
(S_t+I_t)^{(1)}= X_t - TC_t^{(1)}
$$

Step 3: Estimation of the **seasonal** component by applying a $3\times 3$ MA to **each month**
$$
S_t^{(1)}= M_{3\times 3}\left[(S_t+I_t)^{(1)}\right]
\text{ and normalisation }
Snorm_t^{(1)}=S_t^{(1)} - M_{2\times 12}\left(S_t^{(1)}\right)
$$

Step 4: First estimation of the seasonally adjusted series
$$
Xsa_t^{(1)}= (TC_t+I_t)^{(1)} = X_t-Snorm_t^{(1)}
$$


Step 5: Refined estimation of the **trend-cycle** with a Henderson filter, which yields a better approximation fo trends than $2\times 12$ MA, but cannot be applied on a seasonal series
$$
TC_t^{(2)}=H_{13}(Xsa_t^{(1)})
$$
Step 6: Refined estimation of the **seasonal+irregular** part
$$
(S_t+I_t)^{(2)}= X_t - TC_t^{(2)}
$$

Step 7: Refined estimation of the **seasonal** component by applying a $3\times 5$ MA (generally) to **each month/quarter**
$$
S_t^{(2)}= M_{3\times 5}\left[(S_t+I_t)^{(2)}\right]
\text{ and normalisation }
Snorm_t^{(2)}=S_t^{(2)} - M_{2\times 12}\left(S_t^{(2)}\right)
$$

Step 8: Final estimation of the seasonally adjusted series
$$
Xsa_t^{(2)}= X_t - Snorm_t^{(2)}
$$


## Processing stages and output

To evaluate the different components of a series, while taking into
account the possible presence of extreme observations, X-11 will proceed
iteratively: 
- estimation of components
- search for disruptive effects in the irregular component
- estimation of components over a corrected series
- search for disruptive effects in the irregular component
- ...

The steps described above  will be run six times, at least.

The algorithm is split into 

- four processing stages called A, B, C and D

- two diagnostics parts: E tables and Quality Measures (Summary and Detailed )    

### Stage A: Pre-adjustment

If a [pre-treatment](#sa-pre-t) is performed using X-13-Arima algorithm is A step is not used, results in A table appearing in JDemetra+ output are a copy of pre-treatment results.

### Stage B: First automatic correction of the series

This stage consists of a first estimation and [down-weighting of
extreme observations](#X-11-I-correc). This stage is performed by applying twice the algorithm [steps](#X-11-steps) outlined above. It starts with the linearised or raw series copied in table B1 lead to table B20, containing adjustment values for extreme observations.

    adjusted time series;

adjustment. JDemetra+ presents selected output for part F, i.e.:

-   M and Q statistics;

-   Tables.


**The Henderson moving average and the trend estimation**

In iteration B (Table B7), iteration C (Table C7) and iteration D (Table
D7 and Table D12) the trend component is extracted from an estimate of
the seasonally adjusted series using Henderson moving averages. The
length of the Henderson filter is chosen automatically by
X-13ARIMA-SEATS in a two-step procedure.

It is possible to specify the length of the Henderson moving average to
be used. X-13ARIMA-SEATS provides an automatic choice between a 9-term,
a 13-term or a 23-term moving average. The automatic choice of the order
of the moving average is based on the value of an indicator called
$\frac{\overline{I}}{\overline{C}}$ ratio which compares the magnitude
of period-on-period movements in the irregular component with those in
the trend. The larger the ratio, the higher the order of the moving
average selected. Moreover, X-13ARIMA-SEATS allows the user to choose
manually any odd‑numbered Henderson moving average. The procedure used
in each part is very similar; the only differences are the number of
options available and the treatment of the observations in the both ends
of the series. The procedure below is applied for a monthly time series.

In order to calculate $\frac{\overline{I}}{\overline{C}}$ ratio a first
decomposition of the SA series (seasonally adjusted) is computed using a
13-term Henderson moving average.

For both the trend ($C$) and irregular ($I$) components, the average of
the absolute values for monthly growth rates (multiplicative model) or
for monthly growth (additive model) are computed. They are denoted as
$\overline{C}$ and $\overline{I}$, receptively, where:

- $\overline{C} = \frac{1}{n - 1}\sum_{t = 2}^{n}\left| C_{t} - C_{t - 1} \right|$ ;

- $\overline{I} = \frac{1}{n - 1}\sum_{t = 2}^{n}\left| I_{t} - I_{t - 1} \right|$.

Then the value of $\frac{\overline{I}}{\overline{C}}$ ratio is checked
and in iteration B:

-   If the ratio is smaller than 1, a 9-term Henderson moving average is
    selected;

-   Otherwise, a 13-term Henderson moving average is selected.

Then the trend is computed by applying the selected Henderson filter to
the seasonally adjusted series from Table B6. The observations at the
beginning and at the end of the time series that cannot be computed by
means of symmetric Henderson filters are estimated by ad hoc asymmetric
moving averages.

In iterations C and D:

-   If the ratio is smaller than 1, a 9-term Henderson moving average is
    selected;

-   If the ratio is greater than 3.5, a 23-term Henderson moving average
    is selected.

-   Otherwise, a 13-term Henderson moving average is selected.

The trend is computed by applying selected Henderson filter to the
seasonally adjusted series from Table C6, Table D7 or Table D12,
accordingly. At the both ends of the series, where a central Henderson
filter cannot be applied, the asymmetric ends weights for the 7 term
Henderson filter are used.

##### **Choosing the composite moving averages when estimating the seasonal component**

In iteration D, Table D10 shows an estimate of the seasonal factors
implemented on the basis of the modified SI (Seasonal: Irregular)
factors estimated in Tables D4 and D9bis. This component will have to be
smoothed to estimate the seasonal component; depending on the importance
of the irregular in the SI component, we will have to use moving
averages of varying length as in the estimate of the Trend/Cycle where
the $\frac{\overline{I}}{\overline{C}}$ ratio was used to select the
length of the Henderson moving average. The estimation includes several
steps.

***Step 1: Estimating the irregular and seasonal components***

An estimate of the seasonal component is obtained by smoothing, month by
month and therefore column by column, Table D9bis using a simple 7-term
moving average, i.e. of coefficients
$\frac{1}{7} \left\{1,\ 1,\ 1,\ 1,\ 1,\ 1,\ 1\right\}$. In order not to
lose three points at the beginning and end of each column, all columns
are completed as follows. Let us assume that the column that corresponds
to the month is composed of $N$ values
$\left\{ x_{1},\ x_{2},\ x_{3},\ \ldots x_{N - 1},\ x_{N} \right\}$. It
will be transformed into a series
$\left\{ {x_{- 2},x_{- 1}{,x}_{0},x}_{1},\ x_{2},\ x_{3},\ \ldots x_{N - 1},\ x_{N},x_{N + 1},\ x_{N + 1},\ x_{N + 2},\ x_{N + 3} \right\}$
with $x_{- 2} = x_{- 1} = x_{0} = \frac{x_{1} + x_{2} + x_{3}}{3}$ and
$x_{N + 1} = x_{N + 2} = x_{N + 3} = \frac{x_{N} + x_{N - 1} + x_{N - 2}}{3}$.
We then have the required estimates: $S = M_{7}(D9bis)$ and
$I = D9bis - S$.

***Step 2: Calculating the Moving Seasonality Ratios***

For each $i^{\text{th}}$ month the mean annual changes for each
component is obtained by calculating 
$$
{\overline{S}}_{i} = \frac{1}{N_{i} - 1}\sum_{t = 2}^{N_{i}}\left| S_{i,t} - S_{i,t - 1} \right|
$$

and

$$
{\overline{I}}_{i} = \frac{1}{N_{i} - 1}\sum_{t = 2}^{N_{i}}\left| I_{i,t} - I_{i,t - 1} \right|
$$

where $N_{i}$ refers to the number of months $\text{i}$in the data,
and the moving seasonality ratio of month $i$: 

$$
MSR_{i} = \frac{\ {\overline{I}}_{i}}{ {\overline{S}}_{i}}
$$

These ratios are presented in *Details* of the *Quality Measures*
node under the *Decomposition (X11)* section. These ratios are used to
compare the year-on-year changes in the irregular component with those
in the seasonal component. The idea is to obtain, for each month, an
indicator capable of selecting the appropriate moving average for the
removal of any noise and providing a good estimate of the seasonal
factor. The higher the ratio, the more erratic the series, and the
greater the order of the moving average should be used. As for the rest,
by default the program selects the same moving average for each month,
but the user can select different moving averages for each month.

***Step 3: Calculating the overall Moving Seasonality Ratio***

The overall Moving Seasonality Ratio is calculated as follows:

$$
\text{MSR}_{i} = \frac{\sum_{i}^{}{N_{i}\ }\ {\overline{I}}_{i}}{\sum_{i}^{}N_{i}{\overline{S}}_{i}}
$$
***Step 4: Selecting a moving average and estimating the seasonal
component***

Depending on the value of the ratio, the program automatically selects a
moving average that is applied, column by column (i.e. month by month)
to the Seasonal/Irregular component in Table D8 modified, for extreme
values, using values in Table D9.

The default selection procedure of a moving average is based on the
Moving Seasonality Ratio in the following way:

-   If this ratio occurs within zone A (MSR \< 2.5), a $3 \times 3$
    moving average is used; if it occurs within zone C (3.5 \< MSR \<
    5.5), a $3 \times 5$ moving average is selected; if it occurs within
    zone E (MSR  6.5), a $3 \times 9$ moving average is used;

-   If the MSR occurs within zone B or D, one year of observations is
    removed from the end of the series, and the MSR is recalculated. If
    the ratio again occurs within zones B or D, we start over again,
    removing a maximum of five years of observations. If this does not
    work, i.e. if we are again within zones B or D, a $3 \times 5$
    moving average is selected.

The chosen symmetric moving average corresponds, as the case may be 5
($3 \times 3$), 7 ($3 \times 5$) or 11 ($3 \times 9$ $3 \times 9$)
terms, and therefore does not provide an estimate for the values of
seasonal factors in the first 2 (or 3 or 5) and the last 2 (or 3 or 5)
years. These are then calculated using associated asymmetric moving
averages.

## Extreme values: identification and replacement {#X-11-I-correc}

X-13ARIMA-SEATS detects and removes outliers in the Reg-ARIMA part.
However, if there is a seasonal heteroscedasticity in a time series i.e.
the variance of the irregular component is different in different
calendar months. Examples for this effect could be the weather and
snow-dependent output of the construction sector in Germany during
winter, or changes in Christmas allowances in Germany and resulting from
this a transformation in retail trade turnover before Christmas. The
ARIMA model is not on its own able to cope with this characteristic. The
practical consequence is given by the detection of additional extreme
values by X-11. This may not be appropriate if the seasonal
heteroscedasticity is produced by political interventions or other
influences. The ARIMA models assume a constant variance and are
therefore not by themselves able to cope with this problem. Choosing
longer (in the case of diverging weather conditions in the winter time
for the construction sector) or shorter filters (in the case of a
changing pattern of retail trade turnover in the Christmas time) may be
reasonable in such cases. It may even be sensible to take into account
the possibility of period-specific (e.g. month-specific) standard
deviations, which can be done by changing the default settings of the
**calendarsigma** parameter (see
[Specifications-X13](../reference-manual/sa-spec-X13.html) section). The
value of the **calendarsigma** parameter will have an impact on the
method of calculation of the moving standard deviation in the procedure
for extreme values detection presented below.


Though we (should) rely on the pre-adjustment stage to correct for extreme values (transparent method with explicit modelling), X11 has its own (historical) module for identification and treatment of extreme values based on a comparison between the actual and the theoretical value of $I$. 

Stages B and C aim only at correcting for extreme values: 

**Step 1:** $I$ is estimated once $S$ has been extracted from $S+I$

- for each year the standard deviation $\sigma$ is computed on the 5 neighbouring years

- $I$ has a theoretical value $m$, for multiplicative model $m=1$, $m=0$ for an additive model 

- for a given year $y$: any point such as $\lvert I_t - m\rvert >2,5 \sigma_y$ is considered as an extreme value and suppressed....

- ...all the yearly sigmas ($\sigma_y$) are computed without those points (more robust sigmas )


**Step 2:** The distance $\lvert I_t - m\rvert$ is computed for each point and evaluated with $\sigma_{y}$ as a benchmark, a weight $w_t$ is then assigned to each point, 3 cases: 

1) value unchanged 
$$\lvert I_t - m\rvert <1.5 \sigma_y \Rightarrow  w_t=1$$
2) value downsized 
$$1,5 \sigma_y<\lvert I_t - m\rvert <2,5 \sigma_y \Rightarrow w_t=\frac{2.5 \sigma_y -\lvert I_t - m\rvert}{2.5 \sigma_y-1.5 \sigma_y}$$
3) value removed and replaced 
$$\lvert I_t - m\rvert >2,5 \sigma_y \Rightarrow w_t=0$$


**Step3:**
Thanks to this weights, a new value of $S+I$ will be computed: 

- if $w_{t}=1$, $S+I$ remains unchanged for point {t}

- if $w_{t}<1$ then the new value of $S+I$ will be an average of $w_{t}*(S+I)_{t}$ and the values of $(S+I)$ of the two closest neighbors in the future and in the past with $w=1$

#### Filter length choice

A seasonal filter is a weighted average of a moving span of fixed length
within a time series that can be used to remove a fixed seasonal
pattern. X-13ARIMA-SEATS uses several of these filters, according to the
needs of the different stages of the program. As only X-13ARIMA-SEATS
allows the user to manually select seasonal filters, this case study can
be applied only to the X-13ARIMA-SEATS specifications.

The automatic seasonal adjustment procedure uses the default options to
select the most appropriate moving average. However there are occasions
when the user will need to specify a different seasonal moving\
average to that identified by the program. For example, if the SI values
do not closely follow the seasonal component, it may be appropriate to
use a shorter moving average. Also the presence of sudden breaks in the
seasonal pattern: e.g. due to changes in the methodology: can
negatively impact on the automatic selection of the most appropriate
seasonal filter. In such cases the usage of short seasonal filters in
the selected months or quarters can be considered. Usually, a shorter
seasonal filter $(3 \times 1)$ allows seasonality to change very rapidly
over time. However, a very short seasonal filter should not normally be
used, as it might often lead to large revisions as new data becomes
available. If a short filter is to be used it will usually be limited to
one month/quarter with a known reason for wanting to capture a rapidly
changing seasonality.

In the standard situation one seasonal filter is applied to all
individual months/quarters. The estimation of seasonal movements is
therefore based on the sample windows of equal lengths for each
individual month/quarter (i.e. for each month/quarter the seasonal
filter length or the number of years representing the major part of the
seasonal filter weights is identical). This approach relies on the
assumption that the number of past periods in which the conditions
causing seasonal behaviour are sufficiently homogenous is the same in
all months/quarters. However, this assumption does not always hold.
Seasonal causes may change in one month, while staying the same in
others[^m-x11-decomposition-1]. For instance, seasonal
heteroskedasticity might require different filter lengths in different
months or quarters.

[^m-x11-decomposition-1]: When the series are non-stationary
    differentiation is performed before the seasonality tests.

Another interesting example is industrial production in Germany. It can
be influenced by school holidays, since many employees have school-age
children, which interrupt their working pattern during these school
holidays. Consequently, businesses may temporarily suspend or lower
production during these periods. Since school holidays do not occur at
the same time throughout Germany and their timing varies from year to
year in the individual federal states, the effect is not completely
captured by seasonal adjustment. And since school holidays are treated
as usual working days, these effects are not captured by calendar
adjustment either. The majority of school holidays in Germany can take
place either in July or in August. This yields higher variances in the
irregular component for these months compared to the rest of the year.
Therefore, in this case a longer seasonal filter is used for these
months to account for this.

Another example might be given by German retail trade. Due to changes in
the consumers' behaviour around Christmas: possibly more gifts of
money: the seasonal peak in December has become steadily less
pronounced. To account for this moving seasonality, shorter seasonal
filters in December than during the rest of the year need to be applied.

JDemetra+ offers the options to assign a different seasonal filter
length to each period (month or quarter). The program offers these
options in the *single spec* mode as well as in the *multispec* mode,
albeit they are available only in the *Specifications* window, after a
document is created.

### M-stats

The details about the measures are given below.

-   $M1$ measures the contribution of the irregular component to the
    total variance. When it is above 1 some changes in outlier
    correction should be considered.

-   $M2$, which is a very similar to $M1$, is calculated on the basis of
    the contribution of the irregular component to the stationary
    portion of the variance. When it is above 1, some changes in an
    outlier correction should be considered.

-   $M3$ compares the irregular to the trend taken from a preliminary
    estimate of the seasonally adjusted series. If this ratio is too
    large, it is difficult to separate the two components from each
    other. When it is above 1 some changes in outlier correction should
    be considered.

-   $M4$ tests the randomness of the irregular component. A value above
    1 denotes a correlation in the irregular component. In such case a
    shorter seasonal moving average filter should be considered.

-   $M5$ is used to compare the significance of changes in the trend
    with that in the irregular. When it is above 1 some changes in
    outlier correction should be considered.

-   $M6$ checks the $\text{SI}$ (seasonal: irregular components
    ratio). If annual changes in the irregular component are too small
    in relation to the annual changes in the seasonal component, the
    $3 \times 5$ seasonal filter used for the estimation of the seasonal
    component is not flexible enough to follow the seasonal movement. In
    such case a longer seasonal moving average filter should be
    considered. It should be stressed that $M6$ is calculated only if
    the $3 \times 5$ filter has been applied in the model.

-   $M7$ is the combined test for the presence of an identifiable
    seasonality. The test compares the relative contribution of stable
    and moving seasonality[^m-x11-decomposition-2].

-   $M8$ to $M11$ measure if the movements due to the short-term
    quasi-random variations and movements due to the long-term changes
    are not changing too much over the years. If the changes are too
    strong then the seasonal factors could be erroneous. In such case a
    correction for a seasonal break or the change of the seasonal filter
    should be considered.

[^m-x11-decomposition-2]: See section [Combined seasonality
    tests](../theory/Tests_combined.html).

The $Q$ statistic is a composite indicator calculated from the $M$
statistics.

Edit : problem with tables display

$$
\scriptsize
Q = \frac{10M1 + 11M2 + 10M3 + 8M4 + 11M5 + 10M6 + 18M7 + 7M8 + 7M9 + 4M10 + 4M11}{100}
$$ {#eq-1}
<!---\[5.25\]-->

$Q = Q - M2$ (also called $Q2$) is the $Q$ statistic for which the $M2$
statistics was excluded from the formula, i.e.:

$$
\small
Q - M2 = \frac{10M1 + 10M3 + 8M4 + 11M5 + 10M6 + 18M7 + 7M8 + 7M9 + 4M10 + 4M11}{89}
$$ {#eq-2}
<!---\[5.26\]-->

If a time series does not cover at least 6 years, the $M8$, $M9$, $M10$
and $M11$ statistics cannot be calculated. In this case the $Q$
statistic is computed as:

$$
Q = \frac{14M1 + 15M2 + 10M3 + 8M4 + 11M5 + 10M6 + 32M7}{100}
$$

The model has a satisfactory quality if the $Q$ statistic is lower than
1.

The tables displayed in the *Quality measures **→** Details* node
correspond to the F-set of tables produced by the original X-11
algorithm. To facilitate the analysis of the results, the numbers and
the names of the tables are given under each table following the
convention used in LADIRAY, D., and QUENNEVILLE, B. (1999).


#### Detailed Quality measures

In GUI all the diagnostics below can be displayed expanding the NODE

They are detailed in the [X-11 method chapter](M-X11-decomposition.qmd)

In R (to be added)

##### Average percent change (or Average differences) without regard to sign over the indicated span

The first table presents the average percent change without regard to sign of the percent changes (multiplicative model) or average differences (additive model) over several periods (from 1 to 12 for a monthly series, from 1 to 4 for a quarterly series) for the following series:

-   $O$: Original series (Table A1);

-   $\text{CI}$: Final seasonally adjusted series (Table D11);

-   $I$: Final irregular component (Table D13);

-   $C$: Final trend (Table D12);

-   $S$: Final seasonal factors (Table D10);

-   $P$: Preliminary adjustment coefficients, i.e. regressors estimated by the Reg-Arima model (Table A2);

-   $TD\& H$: Final calendar component (Tables A6 and A7);

-   $\text{Mod.O}$: Original series adjusted for extreme values (Table E1);

-   $\text{Mod.CI}$: Final seasonally adjusted series corrected for extreme values (Table E2);

-   $\text{Mod.I}$: Final irregular component adjusted for extreme values (Table E3).

In the case of an additive decomposition, for each component the average absolute changes over several periods are calculated as:

$$\text{Component}_{d} = \frac{1}{n - d}\sum_{t = d + 1}^{n}|Table_{t} - Table_{t - d}|$$

where:

$d$: time lag in periods (from a monthly time series $d$ varies from to 4 or from 1 to 12);

$n$: total number of observations per period;

$\text{Component}$: the name of the component;

$\text{Table}$: the name of the table that corresponds to the component.

![](All_images/RDimage48.png)

For the multiplicative decomposition the following formula is used: $$\text{Component}_{d} = \frac{1}{n - d}\sum_{t = d+1}^{n}{|\frac{\text{Tabl}e_{t}}{\text{Table}_{t - d}} - 1|}$$.

##### Relative contribution to the variance of the differences in the components of the original series

Next, Table F2B of relative contributions of the different components to the differences (additive model) or percent changes (multiplicative model) in the original series is displayed. They express the relative importance of the changes in each component. Assuming that the components are independent, the following relation is valid:

$$O_{d}^{2} \approx C_{d}^{2} + S_{d}^{2} + I_{d}^{2} + P_{d}^{2} + {TD\& H}_{d}^{2}$$

In order to simplify the analysis, the approximation can be replaced by the following equation:

$$O_{d}^{*2} = C_{d}^{2} + S_{d}^{2} + I_{d}^{2} + P_{d}^{2} + {TD\& H}_{d}^{2}$$

The notation is the same as for Table F2A. The column $\text{Total}$ denotes total changes in the raw time series.

Data presented in Table F2B indicate the relative contribution of each component to the percent changes (differences) in the original series over each span, and are calculated as:

$\frac{I_{d}^{2}}{O_{d}^{*2}}$, $\frac{C_{d}^{2}}{O_{d}^{*2}}$, $\frac{S_{d}^{2}}{O_{d}^{*2}}$, $\frac{P_{d}^{2}}{O_{d}^{*2}}$ and $\frac{TD\& H_{d}^{2}}{O_{d}^{*2}}$ where: $O_{d}^{*2} = I_{d}^{2} + C_{d}^{2} + S_{d}^{2} + P_{d}^{2}{+ TD\& H}_{d}^{2}$.

The last column presents the *Ratio* calculated as: $100 \times\frac{O_{d}^{*2}}{O_{d}^{2}}$, which is an indicator of how well the approximation ${(O_{d}^{*})}^{2} \approx O_{d}^{2}$ holds.

##### Average differences with regard to sign and standard deviation over indicated span

When an additive decomposition is used, Table F2C presents the average and standard deviation of changes calculated for each time lag $d$, taking into consideration the sign of the changes of the raw series and its components. In case of a multiplicative decomposition the respective table shows the average percent differences and related standard deviations.

![](All_images/RDimage50.png)

##### Average duration of run

Average duration of run is an average number of consecutive monthly (or quarterly) changes in the same direction (no change is counted as a change in the same direction as the preceding change). JDemetra+ displays this indicator for the seasonally adjusted series, for the trend and for the irregular component.

##### I/C ratio over indicated span and global

The $\frac{I}{C}$ ratios for each value of time lag $d$, presented in Table F2E, are computed on a basis of the data in Table F2A. Global IC is displayed below the table

![](All_images/RDimage52.png)

##### Relative contribution to the stationary part of the variance in the original series

The relative contribution of components to the variance of the stationary part of the original series is calculated for the irregular component ($I$), trend made stationary ($C$), seasonal component ($S$) and calendar effects (TD&H).

The trend is made stationary by by extracting a linear trend from the trend component presented in Table D12.

##### Autocorrelations in the irregular

The last table shows the autocorrelogram of the irregular component from Table D13. In the case of multiplicative decomposition it is calculated for time lags between 1 and the number of periods per year +2 using the formula:

$$\text{Corr}_{k}I = \frac{\sum_{t = k + 1}^{N}{(I_{t} - 1)(I_{t - k} - 1)}}{\sum_{t = 1}^{N}{(I_{t} - 1)}^{2}}$$ where $N$ is number of observations in the time series and $k$ the lag.

For the additive decomposition the formula is: $$Corr_{k}I_{t} = \frac{\sum_{t = k + 1}^{N}{(I_{t} \times I_{t - k})}}{\sum_{t = 1}^{N}{(I_{t})}^{2}}$$

##### Heteroskedasticity

Cochran test on equal variances within each period

The Cochran test is design to identify the heterogeneity of a series of variances. X-13-ARIMA-SEATS uses this test in the extreme value detection procedure to check if the irregular component is heteroskedastic. In this procedure the standard errors of the irregular component are used for an identification of extreme values. If the null hypothesis that for all the periods (months, quarters) the variances of the irregular component are identical is rejected, the standard errors will be computed separately for each period (in case the option *Calendarsigma*=**signif** has been selected).

##### Moving seasonality ratios (MSR)

For each $i^{\text{th}}$ month we will be looking at the mean annual changes for each component by calculating:

$${\overline{S}}_{i} = \frac{1}{N_{i} - 1}\sum_{t = 2}^{N_{i}}|S_{i,t} - S_{i,t - 1}|$$

and

$${\overline{I}}_{i} = \frac{1}{N_{i} - 1}\sum_{t = 2}^{N_{i}}| I_{i,t} - I_{i,t - 1}|$$,

where $N_{i}$ refers to the number of months $\text{i}$ in the data, and the moving seasonality ratio of month $i$:

$$MSR_{i} = \frac{\overline{I}_{i}}{\overline{S}_{i}}$$

The [Moving Seasonality Ratio (MSR)](M-X11-decomposition.qmd) is used to measure the amount of noise in the Seasonal-Irregular component. By studying these values, the user can [select for each period the seasonal filter](../reference-manual/sa-spec-X13.html#seasonal-filter-x11-seasonalma) that is the most suitable given the noisiness of the series.
