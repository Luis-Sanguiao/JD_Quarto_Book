# Benchmarking and temporal disagreggation {.unnumbered #a-bench}

## In this chapter 

The sections below provide guidance on how to implement algortihms on

- benchmarking 

- [temporal disaggregation](#a-bench-tempd)

Using the [GUI]() with a [plug-in]()  or [rjd3bench]() package.

## Benchmarking overview

Often one has two (or multiple) series of different frequency for the same target variable. Sometimes, however, these series are not coherent in the sense that they don't match up. Benchmarking\[\^1\] is a method to deal with this situation. An aggregate of a higher-frequency measurement variables is not necessarily equal to the corresponding lower-frequency less-aggregated measurement. Moreover, the sources of data may have different reliability levels. Usually, less frequent data are considered more trustworthy as they are based on larger samples and compiled more precisely. The more reliable measurements, hence often the less frequent, will serve as benchmark.

In seasonal adjustment methods benchmarking is the procedure that ensures the consistency over the year between adjusted and non-seasonally adjusted data. It should be noted that the [ESS Guidelines on Seasonal Adjustment (2015)](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3859598/6830795/KS-GQ-15-001-EN-N.pdf/d8f1e5f5-251b-4a69-93e3-079031b74bd3), do not recommend benchmarking as it introduces a bias in the seasonally adjusted data. The U.S. Census Bureau also points out that "*forcing the seasonal adjustment totals to be the same as the original series annual totals can degrade the quality of the seasonal adjustment, especially when the seasonal pattern is undergoing change. It is not natural if trading day adjustment is performed because the aggregate trading day effect over a year is variable and moderately different from zero*"\[\^2\]. Nevertheless, some users may need that the annual totals of the seasonally adjusted series match the annual totals of the original, non-seasonally adjusted series\[\^3\].

According to the [ESS Guidelines on Seasonal Adjustment (2015)](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3859598/6830795/KS-GQ-15-001-EN-N.pdf/d8f1e5f5-251b-4a69-93e3-079031b74bd3), the only benefit of this approach is that there is consistency over the year between adjusted and the non-seasonally adjusted data; this can be of particular interest when low-frequency (e.g. annual) benchmarking figures officially exist (e.g. National Accounts, Balance of Payments, External Trade, etc.) and where users' needs for time consistency are stronger.


## Tools 

###  GUI 

1.  With the pre-defined specifications the benchmarking functionality is not
    applied by default following the *ESS Guidelines on Seasonal Adjustment* (2015)
    recommendations. It means that once the user has seasonally adjusted the series with a pre-defined specification the *Benchmarking* node is empty.
	To execute benchmarking click on
    the *Specifications* button and activate the checkbox in the
    *Benchmarking* section.
	
	
	![**Benchmarking option – a default view**](All_images/UDimage1.jpg)


1.  Three parameters can be set here. *Target* specifies the target
    variable for the benchmarking procedure. It can be either the *Original* (the
    raw time series) or the *Calendar
    Adjusted* (the time series adjusted for calendar effects). *Rho* is a value of the AR(1) parameter
    (set between 0 and 1). By default it is set to 1. Finally, *Lambda*
    is a parameter that relates to the weights in the regression
    equation. It is typically equal to 0 (for an additive
    decomposition), 0.5 (for a proportional decomposition) or 1 (for a
    multiplicative decomposition). The default value is 1.

2.  To launch the benchmarking procedure click on the **Apply** button. The
    results are displayed in four panels. The top-left one compares the
    original output from the seasonal adjustment procedure with the result
    from applying a benchmarking to the seasonal adjustment. The
    bottom-left panel highlights the differences between these two
    results. The outcomes are also presented in a table in the top-right
    panel. The relevant statistics concerning relative differences are
    presented in the bottom-right panel.

	
	![**The results of the benchmarking procedure**](All_images/UDimage2.jpg)


1.  Both pictures and the table can be copied the usual way 
    (see the [*Simple seasonal adjustment of a single time series*](../case-studies/simplesa-single.html) scenario).

	
	![**Options for benchmarking results**](All_images/UDimage3.jpg)

	

	

1.  To export the result of the benchmarking procedure (*benchmarking.result*) and
    the target data (*benchmarking.target*) one needs to once execute the seasonal adjustment with benchmarking

	
	![**The *SAProcessing* menu**](All_images/UG_SSA_image28.jpg)

	

	
	
1. Expand the \"+\" menu and choose an appropriate data format (here
    Excel has been chosen). It is possible to save the results in TXT,
    XLS, CSV, and CSV matrix formats. Note that the [available content of
    the output depends on the output type](../theory/output.html).

	
	![**Exporting data to an Excel file**](All_images/UG_SSA_image29.jpg)

	

	

1. Chose the output items that refer to the results from the benchmarking procedure, move them to the window on the right and  click **OK**.

### Benchmarking and Temporal Disaggregation plugin (version 2.x)

Select **Tools $\rightarrow$ Plug-ins** for JDemetra+ to install Benchmarking plug-in.

Once the plugin is installed, two more options appear in the Workspace window: Benchmarking and Temporal Disaggregation.


![Text](All_images/Image1_Bench.jpg)


## Benchmarking with different frequencies 

These methods provide a high-frequency series (input series) modified so that it fulfils a linear relationship, with another series of low frequency (benchmark), both series measure the same target variable. An example of the relation to be fulfilled could be that the low frequency series (quarterly frequency) coincides with the quarterly sum of the high frequency series (monthly frequency).

Multivariate benchmarking also forces contemporary linear relations between high frequency series. If these relations do not exist, benchmarking could be carried out for each series separately. Normally contemporary relations are linear and the relations of aggregation are also linear and the same for all series, so the
contemporary relations between low frequency series are fulfilled.

The benchmarking methods available in the benchmarking and time disaggregation plug-in are: Denton, Cholette, and Cholette multivariate.

### Univariate: Denton and Cholette

To run Denton univariate case select:

Statistical **Methods $\rightarrow$ Benchmarking $\rightarrow$ Denton or Cholette**


![**Benchmarking tab**](All_images/Image2_Bench.png)


In both cases, a new window is displayed to launch one of the methods with the series selected. In the upper left side, drag the high frequency series from the Providers window and drop it in **Drop Series here** and the low frequency series in **Drop Constraint here**.

#### Denton

In the top right of the screen, select the **Specifications** button to set the specifications to apply each method. See below for a description of the available options on Denton method:

1. **Type**: Aggregation function (Sum, Average, Last or First). This forces the
low-frequency series to match the aggregation function selected of the high frequency series.

2. **Multiplicative**: if the checkbox is selected, the proportional Denton method is applied. Otherwise, additive Denton is applied.

3. **Modified Denton**: if the checkbox is selected, the modified Denton method is applied. Otherwise, original Denton is applied. It is recommended to select it; as original Denton perform a special treatment on the first observation.

4. **Differencing**: Number of regular differences. By default 1.

5. **Default frequency**: periodicity of the low frequency data. The options are: Yearly, HalfYearly, QuadriMonthly, Quarterly, Bimonthly and Monthly.



![Denton Specifications](All_images/Image3_Bench.png)

#### Cholette

See below for a description of the available options on Cholette method:

1. **Type**: Aggregation function (Sum, Average, Last or First). This forces the
low-frequency series to match the aggregation function selected of the high frequency series.
2. **Aggregation frequency**: periodicity of the low frequency data. The options are: Yearly, HalfYearly, QuadriMonthly, Quarterly, Bimonthly and Monthly.
3. **Rho**: value between $-1$ and $1$. It is the coefficient of an AR($1$) model that follows the error term. The default value is $1$, equivalent to applying Denton.

4. **Lambda**: value between $0$ and $1$. It is the parameter $\lambda$ of the following function to be minimized in Cholette method:

    $$
    \sum_t \left( \frac{x_t - z_t}{\left| z_t \right|^{\lambda}} - \rho \frac{x_{t-1} - z_{t-1}}{\left| z_{t-1} \right|^{\lambda}}\right)^2
    $$
    
    Usually lambda is $0$ or $1$ equivalent to applying additive benchmarking and proportional benchmarking method respectively.

![Cholette Specifications](All_images/Image4_Bench.png)

In both cases, Denton and Cholette methods, the output is a graph with the original series and the benchmarked series. There is no table with the results, but it is very easy to create one from the graph. Select the graph and select copy, then paste the values in excel (control-V).

## Temporal Disaggregation {#a-bench-tempd}

These methods are used to disaggregate a series from low frequency to high frequency. Temporal disaggregation methods developed in the plug-in are Chow-Lin, Fernández and Litterman.

When there are high frequency related indicators, these methods provide high
frequency estimations for a series whose sums, averages, first or last values are
consistent with the observed low frequency series, applying a regression model
where it is assumed that the high frequency series to be
estimated follows a multiple regression with p related series (indicators).

See Methods$\rightarrow$Temporal disaggregation for more theoretical detail.

### Temporal Disaggregation in the GUI
To run Temporal Disaggregation methods select Temporal disaggregation$\rightarrow$ Regression Model:

![Temporal Disggregation](All_images/Image6_TD.png)

A new window is displayed to launch one of the methods with the series selected. In the upper left side drag the low frequency series from the Providers window and drop it in **Y box** and the proxy series or indicator with high frequency series in **X box**.


![Temporal Disggregation](All_images/Image7_TD.png)


In the top right of the screen, select **Specifications** to set the specifications to apply each method. Here is a description of the available options on Temporal Disaggregation methods:

3. **Parameter**: Coefficient of the AR(1) of the innovations model. It has a value between -1 and 1. This parameter exists only if RWar1 or Ar1 is selected in the error parameter.

4. **Constant**: a constant is included in the model if it is selected.

5. **Trend**: a linear trend is included in the model if it is selected.

6. **Type**: Aggregation function (Sum, Average, Last or First). This forces the
low-frequency series to match the aggregation function selected of the high frequency series.

7. **Default frequency**: it is the frequency of the output series.

8. **Advanced options**: These parameters are related to state space model and the algorithm used to obtain the estimations.

    8.1. **Diffuse regression coefficient**: Indicates if the coefficients of the regression model are diffuse (T) or fixed unknown (F, default).
    


Here are the results:

### Benchmarking and Temporal Disaggregation in R (version 3.x)

Use the [rjd3bench]((https://github.com/rjdemetra/rjd3bench) package and see its documentation pages.

## Benchmarking Univariate: Denton and Cholette

To perform Univariate Benchmarking methods 

## Temporal Disaggregation 

To perform Temporal Disaggregation methods use the function **temporaldisaggregation**: 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
output <- rjd3bench::temporaldisaggregation(
    series = y, indicators = x, model = "Rw", freq = 12,
    conversion = "Average", diffuse.algorithm = "Diffuse"
)
```
The input parameters are the same as in the GUI, see the R Documentation of the rjd3bench package for the description.


The output is a list containing 3 elements:

1. **Regression**: contains information about:

    * Type of method applied:
    
    ```{r,eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
    
    output$regression$type
    
    ```

    * The model (coefficient estimation, standard deviation and T-statistic):
    
    ```{r,eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
    
    output$regression$model
    
    ```

    * Conversion:Aggregation function (Sum, Average, Last or First):
    
    ```{r,eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
    
    output$regression$conversion
    
    ```

    ```{r,eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
    
    output$estimation$edisagg
    
    ```
    

    * The regressor effect:
    ```{r,eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
    
    output$estimation$regeffect
    
    ```

    * The smoothing part:
    ```{r,eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
    
    output$estimation$smoothingpart
    
    ```
    
    * The $rho$ estimation (coefficient of the AR(1) model): This parameter exists only if RWar1 or Ar1 is selected in the model.
    
    ```{r,eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
    
    output$estimation$parameter
    
    ```   

    * The standard deviation of the AR(1) coefficient:
    ```{r,eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
    
    output$estimation$eparameter
    
    ```   
    
3. **Likelihood**: Contains information about the loglikelihood(ll), sum of squares of the residuals of the model (ssq), number of observations (nobs), number of parameters to be estimated (nparams), degrees of freedom (df), Akaike Information Criteria (aic), Akaike Information Criteria Corrected (aicc), Bayesian Information Criteria (bic), Bayesian Information Criteria Corrected (bic2).
