# Doc building companion

## Now page 

Message: 
- a stage at which ton of low hanging fruit (can be done out of bounds)
- a ton of easy "filling-in"

Types of work:
- 

## Delib P 

- look at quarto rendering possibilities (cf doc, + courses)
- aside projects + improve doc 

Warning: secondary vs JD+ mastery


## For NEXT release: end Feb ?

(just before webinar)
Urgent steps: LENS: show it at BCE for SA prod
- how to use this book: quick start / download
- up to date with latest dvlpts in SA realm 
- chapter novelties v3 (incubator)
- SA chaps
- all prod SA related issues cleaned up 
- R code + r packs 
- output : URGENT end KEY
(incidental corrections)

review all this and prioritize int next steps 

- all novelties are ok ? (all novelties highlighted in oecd presentation)
- concepts around specifica
- revision policies in R 
- among which: all r packages (with read me and essential doc: here and linked)
- HF is roughly ok as well (A chap only or A and M)
- gui v3 highlights (att: presenter test gui v3 hf)
- tables v2 vs v3
- gui vs r 
- tough points like mode and co 
- specific scope for each chapter (cf below)
- a handful of references work 

### small stuff to fix (T)

- link to tutos 
- link to cros portal
- software installation : separated chapter (app + R packs )
- example modelling with GUI 
- footnote dispaly in "Decomposition in unobserved components"

### T specifics to battle plan 

(master file in rjd3 development)


## Next steps 

Must be as specific as possible

### Easy 

- edit, enhance (ex; Seats chap,)

- add R code esp v3

### T delegate

- GUI chaps images 
- R code 

### Harder

- novelties: new chapter 
- holes (cf list)
- output chapter

Features MAPs
- R vs GUI X13

## Opportunities 

Unique playing field for high level, high value, high reward 
**deliberate practice**.

## Principles and Policy 

policy: 

- what is displayed in GUI should be explained, even if shortly, adding links to relevant method chapter from GUI: all panels have to be described

- the same does not apply to R packages as they have a documentation on their own 

### Difference with training

-   rationale for params
-   diagnostics
-   what can be changed and how, but not why (or briefly) !


## Book Production Management

### Structure PBS

- revision policies might be misplaced (not a tool, a piece of algo): later 

### Display PBS


### Help

non urgent (= finish up a to of stuff before..)
now just a clean page
- seats : redo step by step (with help of spanish doc) and submit to karsten
(+ alessandro from istat)

### Chapters from scratch 

like stl or ssf 
for ALGO part: paste a well known structure like X-11 and try to fill it in 

## Added value 

### New technical features 

global feel
 - readability, less text 
 -  structure visibility, improved navigation 
     search bar 
     links inter and intra improved 
     clickable pdf, with nice TOC

#### Visual tools 

- expand collapse 

- panels (v2/v3)

- dynamic images 

### New content 

highlight what is new and tables with missing point or state (like maps)
when "sanity check" becomes "maturity check"

#### R ecosystem fully integrated 

Not present in old doc, partly normal...

- fully up to date on ecosystem 
- intra package doc (details) linked to online global doc (context)


#### New elements to improve clarity 

(deep dive later) 

    - frequencies 
    - R vs GUI use 
    - integrated vs non integrated world 

- specific scope for each chapter (cf below)

#### Documentation of v3 new features 

- HF 
- ...
cf list in new features


#### Old features not explained in old doc

(check it)

- reallocation (get back to JP's doc)


## New features to document

Battle plan 
Add a maturity, test check 

### Resources 

- my OECD beamer 

- JD+ technical doc

- slides JP march and june 

- notes (ISI)

- doc Unece 

- doc x13 arima 

- black book

### GUI


### R

- v3 R code in many places (algo part)


## Methodo holes to fill in 

(they are all listed in craft book, doc specific are also listed here)

### In A-X11

- SI ratios, I=D8 

(to be checked: I=D8 or I = D13 ?) (D8 doesn't contain pre-treatment effects and D13 does)

-  mode

- X11 output detail: in meth part..ok ?


### Frequencies 


Discussion on modelling features in gui + single vs multiple  


## Overlapping Issues 

Above chapter level 

### Harmonization of names

-   revision policies: fixed autoregressive parameters

-   output differences v2 vs v3, reallocation wise (Tanguy)

### Key phrases for missing or non tested parts 

- under construction... if related to a whole part

- to be checked

- up coming content (here): ..a few words...

- ref to add

### Package first time in a chapter 

when mentioned the first time: some additional links 

cf RJDemetra in A-X11

add references to prints ?

### Output Appendix

names 
- GUI display 
- GUI output 
- Cruncher output 
- Name R 
- Defintion (top Meth GRID, should be mastered)

att: if possible suggest harmos or simplifications 

### Tables development 

draw first, then table for JP

- synthetic vision 

- Tab1: frequencies (TS) by algo by (R ro GUI)

- R vs GUi for all algos

- what is "integrated vs no"

- images of GUI output (cf my pdfs with R comments voir T)

### Links management 

- links to R packages doc and vignettes

- references and biography 

## In each chapter 

- In this chapter: harmonized intro 

### Specific scope

-   scope by data type

-   contrast differences R vs GUI

-   specify scope: example cruncher doesn't work with stl: obvious ?

-   are revision policies available for HF data ?

-   can we generate calendar regressors for weekly data

-   specify (+ more variety in examples) for which data frequency a function is available

## Templates for Algo chapter description

- default params (quick launch) 

- INPUT (?) 

- Output 1: series 
- Output2: Final Params 
- Output3: Diagnostics 
- User-defined parameters
- 

## Chapter Specific Issues 

### Preface

ok 

### How to Use this Book

### G-jd-history.qmd

to be organized

resources - small publi 4p insee/eurostat (LOST ??!!)

web explo stack

### In All ALGO chapters 

-   R version 3 code to be added
-   remove theory related parts
-   much less text than current doc (too long)
-   method details: to method chapters
-   tools details in tools: GUI or R

when describing parameters

-   1 common description
-   2 setting in GUI
-   3 setting in R



### A-sa-overview

### In A-sa-pre-treatment

#### Clalendar (links)

#### ramps

test: several

see if here: ? The graph and formula are available in [Linearisation with the TRAMO and RegARIMA models](../theory/SA_lin.html).

explain params - differentiation orders D1DS: if ticked: 1 1 automatically (pb differentiation before the real differentiation ??)

#### in reg arima results

-   seasonality tests on residuals (Highlight differences: - in gui - in R v2: retrieve object in output, v3 run test)

#### Allocation to components

allocation when intervention or ramps ? in test allocated to trend ? (reg)

impossible (?) to create several intervention variables

### A-sa-x11-decomposition

### A-sa-seats-decomposition

### A-sa-hf.qmd

### A-outlier-detection.qmd

data type

contrasting GUI and R packages

small chunks on regressors to be added

more info on detection

### A-calendar-correction.qmd

ADD tool map Calendar correction using R packages vs GUI: quick contrasting

- is group and reference day choice as flexible in GUI as in R ?

- in GUI (v3) automatic detection, what in R ?

- are the same data frequencies available in R and in GUI (divisors of 12 and...)

- calendar correction HF data: R vs GUI ? including weekly data

remarks:

-   less dense content, less text more tables, bullet points

-   check and add documents new v3 features

-   cjo frequency explained by K they simulate calendar pattern...empirically fall here (cf refs papers)

frequency 41 et 41 survival of 1/60 discrete step in X12 (cf sokup findley)

#### To do

On theory part:

-   manque effet de paques (cf regressor and ICA: hole)

-   length of period

-   stock

On practical part:

-   HF in GUI ?

-   add in R

-   generating regressors from customized calendar : GUI and R

-   Length of Period

adjust param

-   stcok series

cf book x12 and SH

The regressor will have the value -1 if the w-th day is a Sunday, 1 if it is a Monday as 0 otherwise.

example lacking in the package

explain problems and mixing with seasonality ...

### A-benchmarking.qmd

review maria's work (cfr email remarks)

add rjd3 bench and link help pages

resources

-   corentin, beamer rome

-   maria, ine, beamer ocde

### A-trend-cycle-estimation.qmd

see alain

see karsten paper on HF

### A-nowcasting.qmd

## T-graphical-user-interface.qmd

why use the graphical user interface ? what is not directly available in R yet?

objective: describe the general features (independent of algorithms)

-   general layout

-   options !: like stats tools/ modifs good bad / look and feel

-   import data

-   documents

-   workspaces

-   specifications

-   output


### GUI: SA and Modelling Features

very weak 

lacks new links 

Topics voir what should be tackled here 

- Modelling process new document
<!-- very short explanations, as the same as in pre-adjustment  -->

- Anomaly detection (just structure link to outlier chapter)

- SAP detailed (but not algo specific), just structure 

- Seasonality tests 

- direct indirect seasonal adjustment 

 
### ADD : List of Output items

### T-Production-tools-cruncher-QR

add - List of exportable series (tramo / x13 with names)

-   link to option change for adjusting "good", "bad"...

### T-r-packages

-   add a global description of rjd3toolkit cf aux txt file

-   include details in rjdemetra3 (when ready)

#### Perimeter definition

X11+

- will take all x11 related functions from rjd3highfreq which will stay model based (then seats+ will comme, another pack or not ?)

- simple (extended) airline processing + more choices in all asymetrical filters (better for revisions)**


### T-plug-ins

ok for now, visuals to be checked

### T-rev-policies-production

add - v3 visuals (progressive) 
- fixed auto reg param - inter chapter links : r packs, cruncher

obj here: general explanations + examples ? here : explain voc discrepancies vs guidelines bbk controlled current link to plug in illustration links on covid

#### Revision Policies

general concepts - identified vs estimated - linearization phase - X11 - seats

here concepts of domain spec, point spec

concurrent = first estimation or redo everything (never overrides user defined parameters)

#### Implemententing revision policies in R

### M-spectral-analysis

add: - R code or references to - rjd3sa (?) references to tests - more explanations on spectral analysis rationale

Vocabulary precision and concise definitions - spectral density - periodogram - spectral density estimator - "spectrum" is used too ubiquitously

### M-reg-arima-modelling

In the chapter on SA, in the pre-adjustment section, we tackle: - purpose, principles and results of reg-arima models (tramo or reg-arima)

Here we tackle : - more in depth presentation - details on model estimation (not your typical box and Jenkins)

### M-X11-decomposition.qmd

Questions

- is the A part really used in X-11 model

- in step B: "and, if requested, a first estimation of the
calendar effects" (from old doc: true ?)"


- final tables and effects of pre adjustement 

-   add more computation details: cf my notes on X-11, yes, but not urgent

Edit content goal of the chapter: details on X-11 which won't be in the SA chapter

see - my notes on X-11 - formulas from training yc estp - formulas from HF paper or beamer

### M-STL-decomposition

goal of the chapter : details on STL which are not in the SA chapter

res: - papier HF - papier Daniel on dsa

### M-SEATS-decomposition

### M-Trend-Estimation-Local-Polynomials

### M-tests.qmd

check NBB aux doc for any missing formulas
JP estp adv

LooP 1: sheer toilettage

### M-state-space-framework

beamer - dms moi - koopman

books - durbin - shumway stoffer

edit - change notations to shumway style
