The seasonal adjustment methods available in JDemetra+ aim to decompose
a time series into components and remove seasonal fluctuations from the
observed time series. The X-11 method considers monthly and quarterly
series while SEATS is able to decompose series with 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12
observations per year.

X-13ARIMA is a seasonal adjustment program developed and supported by
the U.S. Census Bureau. It is based on the U.S. Census Bureau's earlier
X-11 program, the X-11-ARIMA program developed at Statistics Canada, the
X-12-ARIMA program developed by the U.S. Census Bureau, and the SEATS
program developed at the Banco de Espa√±a. The program is now used by the
U.S. Census Bureau for a seasonal adjustment of time series.

\hypertarget{motivation}{%
\section{Motivation}\label{motivation}}

The primary aim of the seasonal adjustment process is to remove seasonal
fluctuations from the time series. To achieve this goal, seasonal
adjustment methods decompose the original time series into components
that capture specific movements. These components are: trend-cycle,
seasonality and irregularity. The trend-cycle component includes
long-term and medium-term movements in the data. For seasonal adjustment
purposes there is no need to divide this component into two parts.
JDemetra+ refers to the trend-cycle as trend and consequently this
convention is used here.

\subsection{Overview of Calendar effects in
JDemetra+}\label{overview-of-calendar-effects-in-jdemetra}}

The following description of the calendar effects in JDemetra+ is
strictly based on PALATE, J. (2014).

A natural way for modelling calendar effects consists of distributing
the days of each period into different groups. The regression variable
corresponding to a type of day (a group) is simply defined by the number
of days it contains for each period. Usual classifications are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Trading days (7 groups): each day of the week defines a group
  (Mondays,...,Sundays);
\item
  Working days (2 groups): week days and weekends.
\end{itemize}

The definition of a group could involve partial days. For instance, we
could consider that one half of Saturdays belong to week days and the
second half to weekends.

Usually, specific holidays are handled as Sundays and they are included
in the group corresponding to "non-working days". This approach assumes
that the economic activity on national holidays is the same (or very
close to) the level of activity that is typical for Sundays.
Alternatively, specific holidays can be considered separately, e.g.~by
the specification that divided days into three groups:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Working days (Mondays to Fridays, except for specific holidays),
\item
  Non-working days (Saturdays and Sundays, except for specific
  holidays),
\item
  Specific holidays.
\end{itemize}

\section{Benchmarking overview}\label{benchmarking-overview}}

Often one has two (or multiple) datasets of different frequency for the
same target variable. Sometimes, however, these datasets are not
coherent in the sense that they don't match up. Benchmarking{[}\^{}1{]}
is a method todeal with this situation. An aggregate of a
higher-frequency measurement variables is not necessarily equal to the
corresponding lower-frequency less-aggregated measurement. Moreover, the
sources of data may have different reliability levels. Usually, less
frequent data are considered more trustworthy as they are based on
larger samples and compiled more precisely. The more reliable
measurements, hence often the less frequent, will serve as benchmark.

In seasonal adjustment methods benchmarking is the procedure that
ensures the consistency over the year between adjusted and
non-seasonally adjusted data. It should be noted that the {[}ESS
Guidelines on Seasonal Adjustment (2015){]}
(https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3859598/6830795/KS-GQ-15-001-EN-N.pdf/d8f1e5f5-251b-4a69-93e3-079031b74bd3),
do not recommend benchmarking as it introduces a bias in the seasonally
adjusted data. The U.S. Census Bureau also points out that
``\emph{forcing the seasonal adjustment totals to be the same as the
original series annual totals can degrade the quality of the seasonal
adjustment, especially when the seasonal pattern is undergoing change.
It is not natural if trading day adjustment is performed because the
aggregate trading day effect over a year is variable and moderately
different from zero}''{[}\^{}2{]}. Nevertheless, some users may need
that the annual totals of the seasonally adjusted series match the
annual totals of the original, non-seasonally adjusted
series{[}\^{}3{]}.

According to the {[}ESS Guidelines on Seasonal Adjustment (2015){]}
(https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3859598/6830795/KS-GQ-15-001-EN-N.pdf/d8f1e5f5-251b-4a69-93e3-079031b74bd3),
the only benefit of this approach is that there is consistency over the
year between adjusted and the non-seasonally adjusted data; this can be
of particular interest when low-frequency (e.g.~annual) benchmarking
figures officially exist (e.g.~National Accounts, Balance of Payments,
External Trade, etc.) and where users' needs for time consistency are
stronger.

\hypertarget{underlying-theory-1}{%
\section{Underlying Theory}\label{underlying-theory-1}}

Benchmarking\footnote{Description of the idea of benchmarking is based
  on DAGUM, B.E., and CHOLETTE, P.A. (1994) and QUENNEVILLE, B. et all
  (2003). Detailed information can be found in: DAGUM, B.E., and
  CHOLETTE, P.A. (2006).} is a procedure widely used when for the same
target variable the two or more sources of data with different frequency
are available. Generally, the two sources of data rarely agree, as an
aggregate of higher-frequency measurements is not necessarily equal to
the less-aggregated measurement. Moreover, the sources of data may have
different reliability. Usually it is thought that less frequent data are
more trustworthy as they are based on larger samples and compiled more
precisely. The more reliable measurement is considered as a benchmark.

Benchmarking also occurs in the context of seasonal adjustment. Seasonal
adjustment causes discrepancies between the annual totals of the
seasonally unadjusted (raw) and the corresponding annual totals of the
seasonally adjusted series. Therefore, seasonally adjusted series are
benchmarked to the annual totals of the raw time series\footnote{DAGUM,
  B.E., and CHOLETTE, P.A. (2006).}. Therefore, in such a case
benchmarking means the procedure that ensures the consistency over the
year between adjusted and non-seasonally adjusted data. It should be
noted that the `\emph{ESS Guidelines on Seasonal Adjustment}' (2015) do
not recommend benchmarking as it introduces a bias in the seasonally
adjusted data. Also the U.S. Census Bureau points out that:
\emph{Forcing the seasonal adjustment totals to be the same as the
original series annual totals can degrade the quality of the seasonal
adjustment, especially when the seasonal pattern is undergoing change.
It is not natural if trading day adjustment is performed because the
aggregate trading day effect over a year is variable and moderately
different from zero}.\footnote{'\emph{X-12-ARIMA Reference Manual'}
  (2011).} Nevertheless, some users may prefer the annual totals for the
seasonally adjusted series to match the annual totals for the original,
non-seasonally adjusted series\footnote{HOOD, C.C.H. (2005).}. According
to the `\emph{ESS Guidelines on Seasonal Adjustment}' (2015), the only
benefit of this approach is that there is consistency over the year
between adjusted and non-seasonally adjusted data; this can be of
particular interest when low-frequency (e.g.~annual) benchmarking
figures officially exist (e.g.~National Accounts, Balance of Payments,
External Trade, etc.) where user needs for time consistency are
stronger.

The benchmarking procedure in JDemetra+ is available for a single
seasonally adjusted series and for an indirect seasonal adjustment of an
aggregated series. In the first case, univariate benchmarking ensures
consistency between the raw and seasonally adjusted series. In the
second case, the multivariate benchmarking aims for consistency between
the seasonally adjusted aggregate and its seasonally adjusted
components.

Given a set of initial time series
\[\left\{ z_{i,t} \right\}_{i \in I}\], the aim of the benchmarking
procedure is to find the corresponding

\[\left\{ x_{i,t} \right\}_{i \in I}\] that respect temporal aggregation
constraints, represented by \[X_{i,T} = \sum_{t \in T}^{}x_{i,t}\] and
contemporaneous constraints given by
\[q_{k,t} = \sum_{j \in J_{k}}^{}{w_{\text{kj}}x_{j,t}}\] or, in matrix

form: \[q_{k,t} = w_{k}x_{t}\].

The underlying benchmarking method implemented in JDemetra+ is an
extension of Cholette's\footnote{CHOLETTE, P.A. (1979).} method, which
generalises, amongst others, the additive and the multiplicative Denton
procedure as well as simple proportional benchmarking.

The JDemetra+ solution uses the following routines that are described in
DURBIN, J., and KOOPMAN, S.J. (2001):

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The multivariate model is handled through its univariate
  transformation,
\item
  The smoothed states are computed by means of the disturbance smoother.
\end{itemize}

The performance of the resulting algorithm is highly dependent on the
number of variables involved in the model (\(\propto \ n^{3}\)). The
other components of the problem (number of constraints, frequency of the
series, and length of the series) are much less important
(\(\propto \ n\)).

From a theoretical point of view, it should be noted that this approach
may handle any set of linear restrictions (equalities), endogenous
(between variables) or exogenous (related to external values), provided
that they don't contain incompatible equations. The restrictions can
also be relaxed for any period by considering their "observation" as
missing. However, in practice, it appears that several kinds of
contemporaneous constraints yield unstable results. This is more
especially true for constraints that contain differences (which is the
case for non-binding constraints). The use of a special square root
initialiser improves in a significant way the stability of the
algorithm.

A time series \(x_{t}\) with stationary covariance, mean \(Œº\) and
\(k^{th}\) autocovariance \(E(x_{t}-\mu)(x_{t- k}\mu))=\gamma(k)\) can
be described as a weighted sum of periodic trigonometric functions:
\(sin(\omega t)\) and \(cos(\omega t)\), where \(\omega=\frac{2*pi}{T}\)
denotes frequency. Spectral analysis investigates this frequency domain
representation of \(x_{t}\) to determine how important cycles of
different frequencies are in accounting for the behavior of \(x_{t}\).

Assuming that the autocovariances \(\gamma(k)\) are absolutely
summable(\(\sum_{k =-\infty}^{\infty}|\gamma(k)|<\infty\)), the
autocovariance generating function, which summarizes these
autocovariances through a scalar valued function, is given by equation
{[}1{]}\footnote{HAMILTON, J.D. (1994).}.

\(acgf(z)=\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}{z^{k}\gamma(k)}\),

where \(z\) denotes complex scalar.

Once the equation {[}1{]}is divided by \(\pi\) and evaluated at some
\(z{= e}^{- i\omega} = cos\omega - isin\omega\), where
\(i = \sqrt{- 1}\) and \(\omega\) is a real
scalar,\(\  - \infty < \ \omega < \infty\), the result of this
transformation is called a population spectrum \$f( \omega )\$for
\(\ x_{t}\), given in equation {[}2{]}\footnote{HAMILTON, J.D. (1994).}.

\[f( \omega ) = \frac{1}{\pi}\sum_{k = - \infty}^{\infty}{e^{- ik\omega}\gamma(k)}\]

Therefore, the analysis of the population spectrum in the frequency
domain is equivalent to the examination of the autocovariance function
in the time domain analysis; however it provides an alternative way of
inspecting the process. Because \(f( \omega )\text{dœâ}\) is interpreted
as a contribution to the variance of components with frequencies in the
range \((\omega,\ \omega + d\omega)\), a peak in the spectrum indicates
an important contribution to the variance at frequencies near the value
that corresponds to this peak.

As \$e\^{}\{- i\omega\} = cos\omega - isin\omega,\$the spectrum can be
also expressed as in equation {[}3{]}.

\[f( \omega ) = \frac{1}{\pi}\sum_{k = - \infty}^{\infty}{(cos\omega k - isin\omega k)\gamma(k)}\]

Since \(\gamma(k) = \gamma( - k)\) (i.e.~\$\gamma(k)\$is an even
function of \(k\)) and \(\sin{( - x)}\  = \operatorname{-sin}x\),
{[}3{]} can be presented as equation

\[f( \omega ) = \frac{1}{\pi}\lbrack \ \gamma(0) + 2\sum_{k = 1}^{\infty}{\ \gamma(k)}cos\text{œâk} \rbrack\],

This implies that if autocovariances are absolutely summable the
population spectrum exists and is a continuous, real-valued function of
\(\omega\). Due to the properties of trigonometric functions \$( \cos( -
\omega k ) = \cos( \text{œâk} ) .~\$and \$. ~\cos( \omega + 2\pi j)k =
cos(\omega k ) )\$the spectrum is a periodic, even function of
\(\omega\), symmetric around \(\omega = 0\). Therefore, the analysis of
the spectrum can be reduced to the interval \(( - \pi,\pi).\) The
spectrum is non-negative for all \(\omega \in ( - \pi,\pi)\).

The shortest cycle that can be distinguished in a time series lasts two
periods. The frequency which corresponds to this cycle is
\(\omega = \pi\) and is called the Nyquist frequency. The frequency of
the longest cycles that can be observed in the time series with \(n\)
observations is \(\omega = \frac{2\pi}{n}\) and is called the
fundamental (Fourier) frequency.

Note that if \(x_{t}\) is a white noise process with zero mean and
variance \(\sigma^{2}\), then for all \(|k|> 0\) \(\gamma(k)=0\) and the
spectrum of \(x_{t}\) is constant
(\(f(\omega)= \frac{\sigma^{2}}{\pi}\)) since each frequency in the
spectrum contributes equally to the variance of the process\footnote{BROCKWELL,
  P.J., and DAVIS, R.A. (2002).}.

The aim of spectral analysis is to determine how important cycles of
different frequencies are in accounting for the behaviour of a time
series\footnote{HAMILTON, J.D. (1994).}. Since spectral analysis can be
used to detect the presence of periodic components, it is a natural
diagnostic tool for detecting trading day effects as well as seasonal
effects\footnote{SOKUP, R.J., and FINDLEY, D. F. (1999).}. Among the
tools used for spectral analysis are the autoregressive spectrum and the
periodogram.

The explanations given in the subsections of this node derive mainly
from DE ANTONIO, D., and PALATE, J. (2015) and BROCKWELL, P.J., and
DAVIS, R.A. (2006).

\subsection{Method 1: The periodogram}\label{method-1-the-periodogram}}

For any given frequency \(\omega\) the sample periodogram is the sample
analog of the sample spectrum. In general, the periodogram is used to
identify the periodic components of unknown frequency in the time
series. X-13ARIMA-SEATS and TRAMO-SEATS use this tool for detecting
seasonality in raw time series and seasonally adjusted series. Apart
from this it is applied for checking randomness of the residuals from
the ARIMA model.

To define the periodogram, first consider the vector of complex
numbers\footnote{BROCKWELL, P.J., and DAVIS, R.A. (2002).}:

\$\$\mathbf{x} =

\begin{bmatrix}      


  x_{1} \\                             
  x_{2} \\                             
  . \\                                 
  . \\                                 
  . \\                                 
  x_{n} \\                             
  \end{bmatrix}

\in \mathbb{C}\^{}\{n\}\$\$

where \(\mathbb{C}^{n}\) is the set of all column vectors with
complex-valued components.

The Fourier frequencies associated with the sample size \(n\) are
defined as a set of values \(œâ_{j} = \frac{2\pi j}{n}\),
\(j = - \lbrack \frac{n-1}{2}\rbrack,\ldots,\lbrack\frac{n}{2}\rbrack\),
\(-\pi< \omega_{j} \leq \pi\), \(j\in F_{n}\), where
\({\lbrack n\rbrack}\) denotes the largest integer less than or equal to
\(n\). The Fourier frequencies, which are called harmonics, are given by
integer multiples of the fundamental frequency \(\ \frac{2\pi}{n}\).

Now the \(n\) vectors
\[e_{j} = n^{- \frac{1}{2}}\left(e^{-i\omega_{j}},e^{-i{2\omega}_{j}},
\ldots,e^{- inœâ_{j}}\right)^{'}\] can be defined. Vectors
\[e_{1},\ldots, e_{n}\] are orthonormal in the sense that:

\[
 {\mathbf{e}_{j}^{*}\mathbf{e}}_{k} = n^{- 1}\sum_{r = 1}^{n}e^{ir(\omega_{j} - \omega_{k})} = \left\{ \begin{matrix}  
  1,\ if\ j = k \\                                                                                                         
  0,\ if\ j \neq k \\                                                                                                      
  \end{matrix} \right.\ 
\]

where \[\mathbf{e}_{j}^{*}\] denotes the row vector, which \[k^{th}\]
component is the complex conjugate of the \[k^{th}\] component of
\[\mathbf{e}_{j}\].\footnote{For details see BROCKWELL, P.J., and DAVIS,
  R.A. (2006).} These vectors are a basis of \[F_{n}\], so that any
\[\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{C}^{n}\] can be expressed as a sum of \[n\]
components:

\[
 \mathbf{x} = \sum_{j = - \lbrack\frac{n - 1}{2}\rbrack}^{\lbrack\frac{n}{2}\rbrack}{a_{j}\mathbf{e}_{j}}
\]

where the coefficients
\[a_{j} = \mathbf{e}_{j}^{*}\mathbf{x}=n^{-\frac{1}{2}}\sum_{t = 1}^{n}x_{t}e^{-it\omega_{j}}\]
are derived from {[}3{]} by multiplying the equation on the left by
\[\mathbf{e}_{j}^{*}\] and using {[}1{]}.

The sequence of \(\{a_{j},j\in F_{n}\}\) is referred as a discrete
Fourier transform of \(\mathbf{x}\mathbb{\in C}^{n}\) and the
periodogram \(I(\omega_{j})\) of \(\mathbf{x}\) at Fourier frequency
\(\omega_{j} = \frac{2\pi j}{n}\) is defined as the square of the
Fourier transform \[\{a_{j}\}\] of \(\mathbf{x}\):

\[
{I\left( \omega_{j} \right)\mathbf{=}{\left| a_{j} \right|^{2}}_{\ } = n^{- \ 1}\left| \sum_{t = 1}^{n}x_{t}e^{- it\omega_{j}} \right|^{2}}_{\mathbf{\ }}
\]

From {[}2{]} and {[}3{]} it can be shown that in fact the periodogram
decomposes the total sum of squares
\(\sum_{t = 1}^{n}\left| x_{t} \right|^{2}\) into a sums of components
associated with the Fourier frequencies \[œâ_{j}\]:

\[
  \sum_{t=1}^{n}{\left|x_{t}\right|}^{2} = \sum_{j = - \lbrack\frac{n - 1}{2}\rbrack}^{\lbrack\frac{n}{2}\rbrack}\left|a_{j}\right|^{2} = \sum_{j = - \lbrack\frac{n - 1}{2}\rbrack}^{\lbrack\frac{n}{2}\rbrack}{I\left( \omega_{j} \right)}
\]

If \(\ \mathbf{x\  \in}\ {R}^{n}\), \(\omega_{j}\) and \[{-\omega}_{j}\]
are both in \[\lbrack- \pi, -\pi \rbrack\] and \[a_{j}\] is presented in
its polar form (i.e.\[a_{j} = r_{j}\exp\left( i\theta_{j} \right)\]),
where \(r_{j}\) is the modulus of \[a_{j}\], then {[}3{]} can be
rewritten in the form:

\[
 \mathbf{x} = a_{0}\mathbf{e}_{0} + \sum_{j = 1}^{\lbrack\frac{n - 1}{2}\rbrack}{ {2^{1/2}r}_{j}{(\mathbf{c}}_{j}\cos\theta_{j}{- \mathbf{s}}_{j}\sin\theta_{j}) + a_{n/2}\mathbf{e}_{n/2}}
 \]

The orthonormal basis for \[{R}^{n}\] is
\[\{\mathbf{e}_{0},\mathbf{c}_{1},\mathbf{s}_{1},\ldots,\mathbf{c}_{\lbrack\frac{n - 1}{2}\rbrack},\mathbf{s}_{\lbrack\frac{n - 1}{2}\rbrack},\mathbf{e}_{\frac{n}{2}(excluded\ if\ n\ is\ odd)}\}
\], where:

\[\mathbf{e}_{0}\] is a vector composed of n elements equal to
\[n^{- 1/2}\], which implies that
\[\mathbf{a}_{0}\mathbf{e}_{0} = {(n^{-1}\sum_{t = 1}^{n}x_{t},\ldots,n^{- 1}\sum_{t=1}^{n}x_{t})}^{'}\];

Equation {[}5{]} can be seen as an OLS regression of \[x_{t}\] on a
constant and the trigonometric terms. As the vector of explanatory
variables includes \[n\] elements, the number of explanatory variables
in {[}5{]} is equal to the number of observations. HAMILTON, J.D. (1994)
shows that the explanatory variables are linearly independent, which
implies that an OLS regression yields a perfect fit (i.e.~without an
error term). The coefficients have the form of a simple OLS projection
of the data on the orthonormal basis:

With {[}5{]} the total sum of squares
\(\sum_{t = 1}^{n}\left| x_{t} \right|^{2}\) can be decomposed into
\[2 \times \lbrack\frac{n - 1}{2}\rbrack\] components corresponding to
\[\mathbf{c}_{j}\] and \[\mathbf{s}_{j}\], which are grouped to produce
the ``frequency \[œâ_{j}\]'' component for
\[1 \geq j \geq \lbrack\frac{n - 1}{2}\rbrack\]. As it is shown in the
table below, the value of the periodogram at the frequency
\(\omega_{j}\) is the contribution of the\$~j\^{}\{\text{th}\}\$harmonic
to the total sum of squares
\(\sum_{t = 1}^{n}\left| x_{t} \right|^{2}\).

Obviously, if series were random then each component \$I\left(
\omega\_\{j\} \right)\$would have the same expectation. On the contrary,
when the series contains a systematic sine component having a frequency
\(j\) and amplitude \(A\) then the sum of squares
\(I\left( \omega_{j} \right)\) increases with \(A\). In practice, it is
unlikely that the frequency \(j\) of an unknown systematic sine
component would exacly match any of the frequencies, for which
peridogram have been calcuated. Therefore, the periodogram would show an
increase in intensities in the immediate vicinity of \(j\).\footnote{BOX,
  G.E.P., JENKINS, G.M., and REINSEL, G.C. (2007).}

Note that in JDemetra+ the periodogram object corresponds exactly to the
contribution to the sum of squares of the standardised data, since the
series are divided by their standard deviation for computational
reasons.

Using the decomposition presented in table above the periodogram can be
expressed as:

\[
I\left( \omega_{j} \right)\mathbf{=}\begin{matrix}                                                                                r_{j}^{2} = \frac{1}{2}{(\alpha}_{j}^{2} + \beta_{j}^{2}) = \ {\frac{1}{n}\left( \sum_{t = 1}^{n}{x_{t}\cos{\left( {t\frac{2\pi j}{n}}_{\ } \right)\ }} \right)}^{2} + \frac{1}{n}\left( \sum_{t = 1}^{n}{x_{t}\sin\left( t\frac{2\pi j}{n} \right)_{\ }} \right)^{2} \\   
\end{matrix}
\] {[}12{]}

where \(j = 0,\ldots,\left\lbrack \frac{n}{2} \right\rbrack\)\emph{.}

Since \(\mathbf{x} - \overline{\mathbf{x}}\) are generated by an
orthonormal basis, and
\(\overline{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{=}a_{0}\mathbf{e}_{0}\) {[}5{]} can be
rearranged to show that the sum of squares is equal to the sum of the
squared coefficients:

\[
 \mathbf{x} - a_{0}\mathbf{e}_{0} =\sum_{j=1}^{\lbrack(n - 1)/2\rbrack}\left(\alpha_{j}\mathbf{c}_{j}+\beta_{j}\mathbf{s}_{j}\right) + a_{n/2}\mathbf{e}_{n/2}
 \]. {[}13{]}

Thus the sample variance of \[x_{t}\] can be expressed as:

\$\$

n\^{}\{-
1\}\sum\emph{\{t=1\}\textsuperscript{\{n\}\{\left(x\_\{t\}-\overline{x}\right)\}}\{2\}=n\textsuperscript{\{-1\}\left(\sum\emph{\{k=1\}\^{}\{\lbrack(n
- 1)/2\rbrack\}2\{r}\{j\}\}}\{2\} +\{a}\{n/2\}\}\^{}\{2\}\right)

\$\$, {[}14{]}

where \(a_{n/2}^{2}\) is excluded if \(n\) is odd.

The term \[2{r_{j}}^{2}\] in {[}14{]} is then the contribution of the
\(j^{\text{th}}\) harmonic to the variance and {[}14{]} shows then how
the total variance is partitioned.

The periodogram ordinate \(I\left( \omega_{j} \right)\) and the
autocovariance coefficient \(\gamma(k)\) are both quadratic forms of
\[x_{t}\]. It can be shown that the periodogram and autocovarinace
function are related and the periodogram can be written in terms of the
sample autocovariance function for any non-zero Fourier frequency
\[œâ_{j}\] :\footnote{The proof is given in BROCKWELL, P.J., and DAVIS,
  R.A. (2006).}

\$\$

I\left( \omega\emph{\{j\} \right) = \sum}\{\left\textbar{} k
\right\textbar{} \textless{} n\}\^{}\{~\}\{\widehat{\gamma}\left( k
\right)\}\emph{\{~\}e\^{}\{- ik\omega}\{j\}\} = \{\widehat{\gamma}\left(
0 \right)\}\emph{\{~\} + 2\sum}\{k = 1\}\^{}\{n -
1\}\{\widehat{\gamma}\left( k \right)\cos{(k\omega_{j})}\}\_\{~\} \$\$

and for the zero frequency
\(\ I\left( 0 \right) = n\left| \overline{x} \right|^{2}\).

Once comparing {[}15{]} with an expression for the spectral density of a
stationary process:

\[
f\left( \omega_{\ } \right) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\sum_{k < - \infty}^{\infty}{\gamma\left( k \right)}_{\ }e^{- ik\omega_{\ }} = \frac{1}{2\pi}\left\lbrack {\gamma\left( 0 \right)}_{\ } + 2\left(\sum_{k = 1}^{\infty}{\gamma\left( k \right)\cos{(k\omega_{\ })}} \right) \right\rbrack
\]

It can be noticed that the periodogram is a sample analog of the
population spectrum. In fact, it can be shown that the periodogram is
asymptotically unbiased but inconsistent estimator of the population
spectrum \(f(\omega)\).{[}\^{}75{]} Therefore, the periodogram is a
wildly fluctuating, with high variance, estimate of the spectrum.
However, the consistent estimator can be achieved by applying the
different linear smoothing filters to the periodogram, called lag-window
estimators. The lag-window estimators implemented in JDemetra+ includes
square, Welch, Tukey, Barlett, Hanning and Parzen. They are described in
DE ANTONIO, D., and PALATE, J. (2015). Alternatively, the model-based
consistent estimation procedure, resulting in autoregressive spectrum
estimator, can be applied.

\hypertarget{method-2-autoregressive-spectrum-estimation}{%
\subsection{Method 2: Autoregressive spectrum
estimation}\label{method-2-autoregressive-spectrum-estimation}}

BROCKWELL, P.J., and DAVIS, R.A. (2006) point out that for any
real-valued stationary process \(\left\(x_{t}\right\)\) with continuous
spectral density \(f\left\(\omega\right\)\) it is possible to find both
\(AR(p)\) and \(MA(q)\) processes which spectral densities are
arbitrarily close to \(f\left\(\omega\right)\). For this reason, in some
sense, \(\left\(x_{t}\right\)\) can be approximated by either \(AR(p)\)
or \(MA(q)\) process. This fact is a basis of one of the methods of
achieving a consistent estimator of the spectrum, which is called an
autoregressive spectrum estimation. It is based on the approximation of
the stochastic process \(\left\(x_{t}\right\)\) by an autoregressive
process of sufficiently high order \(p\):

\[
  x_{t} = \mu + \left( \phi_{1}B + \ldots + \phi_{p}B^{p} \right)x_{t} + \varepsilon_{t}
  \]

where \[\varepsilon_{t}\] is a white-noise variable with mean zero and a
constant variance.

The autoregressive spectrum estimator for the series \(x_{t}\) is
defined as: \footnote{Definition from `\emph{X-12-ARIMA Reference
  Manual}' (2011).}

\$\$

\widehat{s}\left( \omega \right) =
10\operatorname{\times}{\log_{10}\frac{\sigma_{x}^{2}}{2\pi{|1 - \sum_{k = 1}^{p}{\widehat{\phi}}_{k}e^{- ik\omega}|}^{2}}}
\$\$

where:

\(\omega\)-- frequency, \(0 \leq \omega \leq \pi\);

\(\sigma_{x}^{2}\) -- the innovation variance of the sample residuals;

\[{\widehat{\phi}}_{k}\] -- \(\text{AR}\left\(k\right\)\) coefficient
estimates of the linear regression of \(x_{t} - \overline{x}\) on
\(x_{t - k} - \overline{x}\), \(1 \leq k \leq p\).

The autoregressive spectrum estimator is used in the visual spectral
analysis tool for detecting significant peaks in the spectrum. The
criterion of \emph{visual significance}, implemented in JDemetra+, is
based on the range \({\widehat{s}}^{\max} - {\widehat{s}}^{\min}\) of
the \(\widehat{s}\left( \omega \right)\) values, where
\({\widehat{s}}^{\max} = \max_{k}\widehat{s}\left( \omega_{k} \right)\);
\({\widehat{s}}^{\min} = \min_{k}\widehat{s}\left( \omega_{k} \right);\)
and \$\widehat{s}\left( \omega\_\{k\} \right)\$is \(k^{\text{th}}\)
value of autoregressive spectrum estimator.

The particular value is considered to be visually significant if, at a
trading day or at a seasonal frequency \(\omega_{k}\) (other than the
seasonal frequency \(\omega_{60} = \pi\)), \$\widehat{s}\left(
\omega\_\{k\} \right)\$is above the median of the plotted values of
\(\widehat{s}\left( \omega_{k} \right)\) and is larger than both
neighbouring values \(\widehat{s}\left( \omega_{k - 1} \right)\) and
\(\widehat{s}\left( \omega_{k + 1} \right)\) by at least
\(\frac{6}{52}\) times the range
\({\widehat{s}}^{\max} - {\widehat{s}}^{\min}\).

Following the suggestion of SOUKUP, R.J., and FINDLEY, D.F. (1999),
JDemetra+ uses an autoregressive model spectral estimator of model order
30. This order yields high resolution of strong components, meaning
peaks that are sharply defined in the plot of
\(\widehat{s}\left( \omega \right)\) with 61 frequencies. The minimum
number of observations needed to compute the spectrum is set to \(n =\)
80 for monthly data and to \(n =\) 60 for quarterly series while the
maximum number of observations considered for the estimation is 121.
Consequently, with these settings it is possible to identify up to 30
peaks in the plot of 61 frequencies. By choosing
\(\omega_{k} = \frac{\text{œÄk}}{60}\) for \$k = \$0,1,\ldots,60 the
density estimates are calculated at exact seasonal frequencies (1, 2, 3,
4, 5 and 6 cycles per year).

The model order can also be selected based on the AIC criterion (in
practice it is much lower than 30). A lower order produces the smoother
spectrum, but the contrast between the spectral amplitudes at the
trading day frequencies and neighbouring frequencies is weaker, and
therefore not as suitable for automatic detection.

SOUKUP, R.J., and FINDLEY, D.F. (1999) also explain that the periodogram
can be used in the \emph{visual significance} test as it has as good as
those of the AR(30) spectrum abilities to detect trading day effect, but
also has a greater false alarm rate\footnote{The false alarm rate is
  defined as the fraction of the 50 replicates for which a visually
  significant spectral peak occurred at one of the trading day
  frequencies being considered in the designated output spectra (SOUKUP,
  R.J., and FINDLEY, D.F. (1999)).}.

The primary aim of seasonal adjustment is to remove the unobservable
seasonal component from the observed series. The decomposition routines
implemented in the seasonal adjustment methods make specific assumptions
concerning the input series. One of the crucial assumptions is that the
input series is stochastic, i.e.~it is clean of deterministic effects.
Another important limitation derives from the symmetric linear filter
used in TRAMO-SEATS and X-13ARIMA-SEATS. A symmetric linear filter
cannot be applied to the first and last observations with the same set
of weights as for the central observations{[}\^{}1{]}. Therefore, for
the most recent observations these filters provide estimates that are
subject to revisions.

To overcome these constrains both seasonal adjustment methods discussed
here include a modelling step that aims to analyse the time series
development and provide a better input for decomposition purposes. The
tool that is frequently used for this purpose is the ARIMA model, as
discussed by BOX, G.E.P., and JENKINS, G.M. (1970). However, time series
are often affected by the outliers, other deterministic effects and
missing observations. The presence of these effects is not in line with
the ARIMA model assumptions. The presence of outliers and other
deterministic effects impede the identification of an optimal ARIMA
model due to the important bias in the estimation of parameters of
\href{../theory/ACF_and_PACF.html}{sample autocorrelation functions}
(both global and partial){[}\^{}3{]}. Therefore, the original series
need to be corrected for any deterministic effects and missing
observations. This process is called linearisation and results in the
stochastic series that can be modelled by ARIMA.

For this purpose both TRAMO and RegARIMA use regression models with
ARIMA errors. With these models TRAMO and RegARIMA also produce
forecasts.

In the bottom part the panel \href{../theory/SA_lin.html}{the ARIMA
model} used by TRAMO is presented using symbolic notation
\textbackslash((P,D,Q)(PB,DB,QB)\textbackslash). Estimated parameters'
coefficients (regular and seasonal AR and MA) are shown in closed form
(i.e.~using the backshift operator\footnote{A backshift operator
  \textbackslash(B~\textbackslash)is defined as:
  (\(B^{k}x_{t} = x_{t - k})\). It is used to denote lagged series.}
\textbackslash(B\textbackslash)). For each regular AR root (i.e.~the
solution of the characteristic equation) the
\protect\hyperlink{derivation-of-the-models-for-the-components}{argument
and modulus} are given.

For each regular AR root the argument and modulus are also reported (if
present, i.e.~if \textbackslash(\mathbf{P > 0}\textbackslash)) to inform
to which time series component the regular roots would be assigned.
