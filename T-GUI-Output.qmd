## Output from SA Processing

### Steps

1.  Once a seasonal adjustment process for the dataset is performed Go to the TOP menu bar and follow the path: *SAProcessing* â†’ *Output...*

2.  In the *Batch output* window the user can specify which output items will be saved and the folder in which JDemetra+ saves the results. It is possible to save the results in the *TXT*, *XLS*, *CSV*, and *CSV matrix* formats. In the first step the user should choose the output format from the list.

3.  The user may choose more than one format as the output can be generated in different formats at the same time.

4.  To display and modify the settings click on the given output format on the list. The available options depend on the output format.

5.  For *Csv* format the following options are available: *folder* (location of the file), *file prefix* (name of the file), *presentation* (controls how the output is divided into separate files) and *series* (series included in the file). These options are presented in the next points of this case study.

6.  The user can define the folder in which the selected results and components will be saved (click the *folder* item and choose the final destination).

7.  With the option *File Prefix* the user can modify the default name of the output saved in the CSV file.

8.  *Layout* controls how the output is divided into separate files. Expand the list to display available options:

    -   *HTable* -- the output series will be presented in the form of horizontal tables (time series in rows).

    -   *VTable* -- the output series will be presented in the form of vertical tables (time series in columns).

    -   *List* -- the output series will be presented in the form of vertical tables (time series in rows). Apart from that, for each time series each file contains in separate columns: the data frequency, the first year and of estimation span, the first period (month or quarter) of observation span and the number of observations. The files do not include dates.

9.  The *Content* section presents [a list of series that will be included into a set of output files](../theory/output.html). To modify the initial settings click on the grey button in the *Content* section. The *CVS-series* window presents two panels: the panel on the left includes a list of all valuable output items. The panel on the right presents the selected output items. Mark the series and use the arrows to change the settings. Confirm your choice with the *OK* button.

10. Options available for the *XLS* format are the same as for the *TXT* format with an exception of the *Layout* section. The list of available codes in the *Content* section is given [here](../theory/output.html).

    -   *BySeries* -- all results for a given time series are placed in one sheet;

    -   *ByComponent* -- results are grouped by components. Each component type is saved in a separate sheet.

    -   *OneSheet* -- all results are saved in one sheet.

11. If the user sets the option layout to *ByComponent*, the output will be generated as follows:

    ![**An Excel file view for the *ByComponent* option**](All_images/UDimage14.jpg)

12. The option *OneSheet* will produce the following *XLS* file:

13. By default, the series in the Excel output files are organised vertically. When the user unmarks the check box the horizontal orientation is used.

14. In the case of the *TXT* format the only available options are *folder* (location of the file) and *series* (results included in the output file). The list of available codes in the *Content* section is given [here](../theory/output.html).

    ![**Options for the *Txt* output**](All_images/UDimage17.jpg)

15. The *CSV matrix* produces the CSV file containing information about the model and quality diagnostics of the seasonal adjustment. The user may generate the list of default items or create their own quality report. By default, all the available items are included in the output. The list of the items is given [here](../theory/output.html).

16. Once the output settings are selected, click the *OK* button.

17. For each output JDemetra+ provides information on the status of the operation. An example is presented below.
