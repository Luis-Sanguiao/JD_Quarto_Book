# Seasonal Adjustment

## Motivation

The primary aim of the seasonal adjustment process is to remove seasonal
fluctuations from the time series. To achieve this goal, seasonal
adjustment methods decompose the original time series into components
that capture specific movements. These components are: trend-cycle,
seasonality and irregularity. The trend-cycle component includes
long-term and medium-term movements in the data. For seasonal adjustment
purposes there is no need to divide this component into two parts.
JDemetra+ refers to the trend-cycle as trend and consequently this
convention is used here.
