# Seasonal Adjustment {.unnumbered}

Hint at GUI chap for global principles - ws structure (new SAP) - global specification handling - file structure explanation

Hint at tool selection (link to chapter)

add 1 or 2 chpters of quick launch

## Motivation

The primary aim of the seasonal adjustment process is to remove seasonal fluctuations from the time series. Seasonal fluctuations are quasi-periodic infra-annual movements. They can mask...

\[insert def SA from b_ov\]

-   infra annual periodic numbers
-   no unamigous definititon
-   depends on its practial estimation

## Data frequencies : high and low

Until recently seasonal where designed to tackly monthly frequencies or lower in JD+, X13- Seats Arima : 2,4,12 Seats : 2,3,4,6,12

For infra monthly data

## Unobserved Components (UC)

The main components, each representing the impact of certain types of phenomena on the time series ($X_{t}$), are:

-   The trend ($T_{t}$) that captures long-term and medium-term behaviour;

-   The seasonal component ($S_{t}$) representing intra-year fluctuations, monthly or quarterly, that are repeated more or less regularly year after year;

-   The irregular component ($I_{t}$) combining all the other more or less erratic fluctuations not covered by the previous components.

In general, the trend consists of 2 sub-components:

-   The long-term evolution of the series;

-   The cycle, that represents the smooth, almost periodic movement around the long-term evolution of the series. It reveals a succession of phases of growth and recession. Trend and cycle are not separated in SA alogrithms.

Two decomposition models:

-   The additive model: $X_{t} = T_{t} + S_{t} + I_{t}$;

-   The multiplicatve model: $X_{t} = T_{t} \times S_{t} \times I_{t}$.

In the Reg-Arima (link) or Tramo(link) modelling the the multplicative model is estimated in logs; $log(X_{t}) = log(T_{t}) + log(S_{t}) + log(I_{t})$; Seats decompostion also relies on logs wheres X-11 decomp operates...

## Detecting seasonal patterns

Seasonality tests (chap M_Tests)

## Available algorithms

(link to table)

The two most popular are..

X-13ARIMA is a seasonal adjustment program developed and supported by the U.S. Census Bureau. It is based on the U.S. Census Bureau's earlier X-11 program, the X-11-ARIMA program developed at Statistics Canada, the X-12-ARIMA program developed by the U.S. Census Bureau.

Tramo-Seats

Those will be the most detailed in this doc, but there alternative solutions.

STL

BSM

X13 and TS are two step algos, pretreatment +dcomp (no pre ptreatment in STL + all at once in BSM)

-   pre-treatment objectives and methods

-   decomposition objective and methods

## Pre-treatment : Reg-ARIMA (or TRAMO)

rationale

NOTE: Modelling

this should just be a "note" not a part

(small addendum) the reg arima part can be run without decompostion slight differences in parameters

ref to additionnal chapter ?

### Global outline

let's call it regArima modelling (and tramo only when TRamo differences are outlined)

GOAL : remove deterministic effects to improve decompostion (details on modelling: link)

global structure regression with ARIMA structure for residuals $$
Y_t = \sum {\alpha}_i O_{it} + \sum\beta_j C_{jt} + \sum {\gamma}_i U_{it} + Y_{lin,t}
$$ where - $O_{it}$ are the $i$ final outliers (Ao, LS, TC) from an automatic detection pocedure (link to outliers chap)

-   $C_{it}$ are the calendar regressors (automatic or user-defined) (link to calendar chap)

-   $U_{it}$ are all the other user-defined regressors (link to outliers and regressors chap)

-   $Y_{lin,t} \sim ARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)$

In the following sections we cover in more details: not the tight structure - Default params: (quick launch) INPUT (?) - Setting User-defined parameters (and not at the end post diagnostics ?) - Output1: series - Output2: Final Params - Output3: Diagnostics for each of these steps - calendar (auto and user) - outliers (auto and user) - adding intervention variables (here: just how to feed the model, details on regressor and calendar specif chapter) - aima models parameters annd diagno

RegArima modelling part can be of an SA process or run on its own - GUI - R (sligthly different specs,...)

WARNING : set params + retrieve their values: global principles

in GUI

Retrieve: in the specification window and panels for main (to detail ?)

in R

### Default Specifications

here general explanations

default specification are set for the whole sa procedure: pre-treatment end decomposition

they are slightly different for X13-ARIMA and tramo seats

the user chooses the algo + one default spec

this default spec can be modified with user defined params for most of its parts, this is tackeled in details dor every sub part of the reg arima (tramo) modelling and corresponding decompostion (x11 and seats)

#### Setting the model span

Setting works the same way as settinf series (estimation) span described above. But here, the user can specify the span (data interval) of the time series to be used for the estimation of the RegARIMA model coefficients. It allows to impede a chosen part of the data from influencing the regression estimates. 

Additionnal (vs series span setting) parameters are described below:

+--------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Tolerance                | Convergence tolerance for the nonlinear estimation.                                                                         |
|                          |                                                                                                                             |
|                          | The absolute changes in the log-likelihood are compared to Tolerance to check the convergence of the estimation iterations. |
|                          |                                                                                                                             |
|                          | The default setting is 0.0000001.                                                                                           |

+--------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Exact ML                 | When this option is marked, an exact maximum likelihood estimation is performed.                                            |
|                          |                                                                                                                             |
|                          | Alternatively, the Unconditional Least Squares method is used.                                                              |

|                          | However, in the current version of JDemetra+ it is not recommended to change this parameter's value                         |
+--------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Unit Root Limit          | Limit for the autoregressive roots. If the inverse of a real root of the autoregressive polynomial of the                   |
|                          |                                                                                                                             |
|                          | ARIMA model is higher than this limit, the root is set equal to 1. The default parameter value is 0.96.                     |
+--------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Setting in GUI:

Use the specification window

![Model span setting](All_images/SA_REGA_model_spans.png)

Setting in R

Specific settingcnot possible (to confirm), estimation span and model span must be equal. So additional Tramo parameters for model span are set on the estimation span.

Tramo example:
version 2

```{r, eval=FALSE}

#excluding first 24 and last 36 observations
user_spec_1<-tramoseats_spec( spec = c("RSAfull", "RSA0", "RSA1", "RSA2", "RSA3", "RSA4", "RSA5"),  
estimate.tol = 0.0000001, 
estimate.eml = FALSE, 
estimate.urfinal = 0.98)

```

Transformation test -- a test is performed to choose between an additive decomposition (no transformation) (link to reg A chap to detail this)

Settings

Function

transform {function=}

Transformation of data. 2 The user can choose between:

None -- no transformation of the data;

Log -- takes logs of the data;

Auto -- the program tests for the log-level specification. This option is recommended for automatic modelling of many series.

The default setting is Auto.

Reg-Arima specific settings

AIC difference

transform {aicdiff=}

Defines the difference in AICC needed to accept no transformation over a log transformation when the automatic transformation

    selection option is invoked. The option is disabled when Function is not set to Auto. The default AIC difference value is -2.

Adjust

transform {adjust=}

Options for proportional adjustment for the leap year effect. The option is available when Function is set to Log. Adjust can be set to:

LeapYear -- performs a leap year adjustment of monthly or quarterly data;

LengthofPeriod -- performs a length-of-month adjustment on monthly data or length-of-quarter adjustment on quarterly data;

None -- does not include a correction for the length of the period.

The default setting is None

Tramo specific settings

**Fct**\
*Transformation; fct*

Controls the bias in the log/level pre-test (the function is active when **Function** is set to *Auto*); **Fct** \> 1 favours levels, **Fct** \< 1 favours logs. The default setting is 0.95.

### Calendar correction

Rationale : why correct (in a nutshell)

Method regression as deterministic effects, details of regressor building in calendar chapter [building](A-calendar-and-input.qmd#Overview%20of%20Calendar%20effects%20in%20JDemetra)

#### Default specifications for calendar correction

Options related to calendar regressors choice are embedded into default specifications described above (link)

National calendars not taken into accout.

-   working days

-   trading days

-   Leap year regressor

-   Test: Remove/ Add / None

-   Easter

-   Test add / remove / non

-   duration (enabled when testing removed)

-   Julian

-   pre-test

##### GUI Retrieving parameters which are in use

Automatically chosen or user-defined calendar options (as well as other pre-adjustment options) are 
displayed at th top of the MAIN Results NODE

![Text](All_images/SA_REGA_retrieve_cal_options_MAIN.png)

Details of regression results are displayed in the pre processing panel

##### GUI Setting options



##### R: Setting this options and retrieveing parameters which are in use

#### Customizing calendars

How to correct this ?

solution 1: if working with GUI build a new calendar in GUI (building details in chap C) set this option import it : here

version 3:

solution 2: import external regressors can be built with rjd3modelling (link) which can then be used in via are or imported via GUI

set this option in GUI how to import vaiables into JD+ / set utility (in interface chapter) calssical user defined

set this option in R version 2:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
spec_4 <- x13_spec(spec = spec_1, 
                   tradingdays.option = "UserDefined", 
                   tradingdays.test = "None", 
                   usrdef.varEnabled = TRUE, 
                   usrdef.varType = "Calendar", 
                   usrdef.var = reg3) # set of regressors in TS format
```

version 3

(generic sentence to quasi repeat at the end of each part) Once regressors set, the RegArima (tramo) model will be estimated gloablly with all the other regression variables and taking into account arima model specificities as well. That is why diagnostics are all jointly displayed at the end of the process. (link)

### Outliers and intervention variables

quick intro: rational = improve decomposition (cf guidelines) (determinsitic= effects estimated by regression 2 ways - (customizable) automatic detection - user prespecifified outliers

#### Automatic detection

overview: one sentence

##### what can be set (list)

(what do we look for) : AO, LS, TC (detailed in outliers chapter link), how cf. RegArima method chapter types can be set and TC rate specified SO can be added to detection detection - detection enabled - detection span - types of outliers (+ rate for TC) - critical value ("method" = is an incative parameter, always add one)

all is identic for TRamo

```

### Arima Model

Once regressors have been defined, the software looks for a structure of the autocorrelations of the lneariezd series

The arima model will be evaluated lookng at its residuals supposed to be a whiet noise

#### Default specifications

Key specifications on arima model are embedded in default specifications: airline (daufault model) or full automatic reserach.

automdl.enabled a logical. If TRUE, the automatic modelling of the ARIMA model is enabled. If FALSE, the parameters of the ARIMA model can be specified.

A word on restrictions; can some setting be mixed, ex user model and different u roots limits

Forecast horizon is in X-11..

#### Modifing automatic detection

Control variables for the automatic modelling of the ARIMA model (when automdl.enabled is set to TRUE):

automdl.acceptdefault\
a logical. If TRUE, the default model (ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1)) may be chosen in the first step of the automatic model identification. If the Ljung-Box Q statistics for the residuals is acceptable, the default model is accepted and no further attempt will be made to identify another model.

automdl.cancel\
the cancelation limit (numeric). If the difference in moduli of an AR and an MA roots (when estimating ARIMA(1,0,1)(1,0,1) models in the second step of the automatic identification of the differencing orders) is smaller than the cancelation limit, the two roots are assumed equal and cancel out.

automdl.ub1 the first unit root limit (numeric). It is the threshold value for the initial unit root test in the automatic differencing procedure. When one of the roots in the estimation of the ARIMA(2,0,0)(1,0,0) plus mean model, performed in the first step of the automatic model identification procedure, is larger than the first unit root limit in modulus, it is set equal to unity.

automdl.ub2 the second unit root limit (numeric). When one of the roots in the estimation of the ARIMA(1,0,1)(1,0,1) plus mean model, which is performed in the second step of the automatic model identification procedure, is larger than second unit root limit in modulus, it is checked if there is a common factor in the corresponding AR and MA polynomials of the ARMA model that can be cancelled (see automdl.cancel). If there is no cancellation, the AR root is set equal to unity (i.e. the differencing order changes).

automdl.mixed\
a logical. This variable controls whether ARIMA models with non-seasonal AR and MA terms or seasonal AR and MA terms will be considered in the automatic model identification procedure. If FALSE, a model with AR and MA terms in both the seasonal and non-seasonal parts of the model can be acceptable, provided there are no AR or MA terms in either the seasonal or non-seasonal terms.

automdl.balanced\
a logical. If TRUE, the automatic model identification procedure will have a preference for balanced models (i.e. models for which the order of the combined AR and differencing operator is equal to the order of the combined MA operator).

automdl.armalimit\
the ARMA limit (numeric). It is the threshold value for t-statistics of ARMA coefficients and constant term used for the final test of model parsimony. If the highest order ARMA coefficient has a t-value smaller than this value in magnitude, the order of the model is reduced. If the constant term t-value is smaller than the ARMA limit in magnitude, it is removed from the set of regressors.

automdl.reducecv\
numeric, ReduceCV. The percentage by which the outlier's critical value will be reduced when an identified model is found to have a Ljung-Box statistic with an unacceptable confidence coefficient. The parameter should be between 0 and 1, and will only be active when automatic outlier identification is enabled. The reduced critical value will be set to (1-ReduceCV)\*CV, where CV is the original critical value.

automdl.ljungboxlimit\
the Ljung Box limit (numeric). Acceptance criterion for the confidence intervals of the Ljung-Box Q statistic. If the LjungBox Q statistics for the residuals of a final model is greater than the Ljung Box limit, then the model is rejected, the outlier critical value is reduced and model and outlier identification (if specified) is redone with a reduced value.

automdl.ubfinal numeric, final unit root limit. The threshold value for the final unit root test. If the magnitude of an AR root for the final model is smaller than the final unit root limit, then a unit root is assumed, the order of the AR polynomial is reduced by one and the appropriate order of the differencing (non-seasonal, seasonal) is increased. The parameter value should be greater than one.

#   automdl.armalimit = NA_integer_,
#   automdl.reducecv = NA_integer_,
#   automdl.ljungboxlimit = NA_integer_,
#   automdl.ubfinal = NA_integer_,


```

#### User-defined Arima model

Control variables for the non-automatic modelling of the ARIMA model (when automdl.enabled is set to FALSE):

arima.mu\
logical. If TRUE, the mean is considered as part of the ARIMA model.

arima.p numeric. The order of the non-seasonal autoregressive (AR) polynomial.

arima.d numeric. The regular differencing order.

arima.q numeric. The order of the non-seasonal moving average (MA) polynomial.

arima.bp\
numeric. The order of the seasonal autoregressive (AR) polynomial.

arima.bd\
numeric. The seasonal differencing order.

arima.bq\
numeric. The order of the seasonal moving average (MA) polynomial.

Control variables for the user-defined ARMA coefficients. Coefficients can be defined for the regular and seasonal autoregressive (AR) polynomials and moving average (MA) polynomials. The model considers the coefficients only if the procedure for their estimation (arima.coefType) is provided, and the number of provided coefficients matches the sum of (regular and seasonal) AR and MA orders (p,q,bp,bq).

arima.coefEnabled\
logical. If TRUE, the program uses the user-defined ARMA coefficients.

arima.coef\
a vector providing the coefficients for the regular and seasonal AR and MA polynominals. The vector length must be equal to the sum of the regular and seasonal AR and MA orders. The coefficients shall be provided in the following order: regular AR (Phi; p elements), regular MA (Theta; q elements), seasonal AR (BPhi; bp elements) and seasonal MA (BTheta; bq elements). E.g.: arima.coef=c(0.6,0.7) with arima.p=1, arima.q=0,arima.bp=1 and arima.bq=0.

arima.coefType\
a vector defining the ARMA coefficients estimation procedure. Possible procedures are: "Undefined" = no use of any user-defined input (i.e. coefficients are estimated), "Fixed" = the coefficients are fixed at the value provided by the user, "Initial" = the value defined by the user is used as the initial condition. For orders for which the coefficients shall not be defined, the arima.coef can be set to NA or 0, or the arima.coefType can be set to "Undefined". E.g.: arima.coef = c(-0.8,-0.6,NA), arima.coefType = c("Fixed","Fixed","Undefined").

(for both options) fcst.horizon\
the forecasting horizon (numeric). The forecast length generated by the RegARIMA model in periods (positive values) or years (negative values). By default, the program generates a two-year forecast (fcst.horizon set to -2).

## X-11 Decompostion

This part explains how to **use** X-11 decomposition algorithm, via R as well as via GUI. The algorithm itself is explained in more details [here](M-X11-decomposition.qmd)

In a nutshell, X-11 will de deompose the **linearized series** using iteratively different moving averages iteratively. The effects of pre-treatment will be reallocated at the end.

### Default specifications

The default specifications for X-11 must be chosen at the starting of the SA processing. They are detailed in the [RegArima part](A-sa.qmd#Pre-treatment:%20Reg-ARIMA%20(or%20TRAMO)) Note: X-11 can be run without pre-treatment

#### M-statistics

At the end of the decomposition, X-11 algorithm provides quality mesures of the decomposition called "M statistics": 11 statistics (M1 to M11) and 2 summary indicators (Q et Q-M2). By design (clickable) $0<M_x<3$ and acceptance region is $M_x \leq 1$ Formula for $Q$ (They are based on F-tables)

-   **M1** The relative contribution of the irregular over three months span
-   **M2** The relative contribution of the irregular component to the stationary portion of the variance
-   **M3** The amount of month to month change in the irregular component as compared to the amount of month to month change in the trend-cycle (I/C-ratio)
-   **M5** MCD (Months for Cyclical Dominance): The number of months it takes the change in the trend-cycle to surpass the amount of change in the irregular
-   **M6** The amount of year to year change in the irregular as compared to the amount of year to year change in the seasonal (only valid for 3x5 seasonal filter)
-   **M7** The amount of moving seasonality present relative to the amount of stable seasonality
-   **M8** The size of the fluctuations in the seasonal component throughout the whole series
-   **M9** The average linear movement in the seasonal component throughout the whole series
-   **M10** Same as 8, calculated for recent years only (4 years, N-2 to N-5)
-   **M11** Same as 9, calculated for recent years only

add composite indicators \\(Q\\) and \\(Q - M2.\\)

The $Q$ statistic is a composite indicator calculated from the $M$ statistics.

$$Q = \frac{10M1 + 11M2 + 10M3 + 8M4 + 11M5 + 10M6 + 18M7 + 7M8 + 7M9 + 4M10 + 4M11}{100}$$

$Q = Q - M2$ (also called $Q2$) is the $Q$ statistic for which the $M2$ statistics was excluded from the formula, i.e.:

$$Q - M2 = \frac{10M1 + 10M3 + 8M4 + 11M5 + 10M6 + 18M7 + 7M8 + 7M9 + 4M10 + 4M11}{89}$$

If a time series does not cover at least 6 years, the $M8$, $M9$, $M10$ and $M11$ statistics cannot be calculated. In this case the $Q$ statistic is computed as:

$$Q = \frac{14M1 + 15M2 + 10M3 + 8M4 + 11M5 + 10M6 + 32M7}{100}$$

The model has a satisfactory quality if the $Q$ statistic is lower than 1.

##### Average percent change (or Average differences) without regard to sign over the indicated span

(here clarify notations) (link to tables details in meth chapter or appendix) (here A, D, E are needed) (link to Ladiray-Quenneville)

The first table presents the average percent change without regard to sign of the percent changes (multiplicative model) or average differences (additive model) over several periods (from 1 to 12 for a monthly series, from 1 to 4 for a quarterly series) for the following series:

-   $O$ -- Original series (Table A1);

-   $\text{CI}$ -- Final seasonally adjusted series (Table D11);

-   $I$ -- Final irregular component (Table D13);

-   $C$ -- Final trend (Table D12);

-   $S$ -- Final seasonal factors (Table D10);

-   $P$ -- Preliminary adjustment coefficients, i.e. regressors estimated by the RegARIMA model (Table A2);

-   $TD\& H$ -- Final calendar component (Tables A6 and A7);

-   $\text{Mod.O}$ -- Original series adjusted for extreme values (Table E1);

-   $\text{Mod.CI}$ -- Final seasonally adjusted series corrected for extreme values (Table E2);

-   $\text{Mod.I}$ -- Final irregular component adjusted for extreme values (Table E3).

In the case of an additive decomposition, for each component the average absolute changes over several periods are calculated as:

$$\text{Component}_{d} = \frac{1}{n - d}\sum_{t = d + 1}^{n}|Table_{t} - Table_{t - d}|$$

where:

$d$ -- time lag in periods (from a monthly time series $d$ varies from to 4 or from 1 to 12);

$n$ -- total number of observations per period;

$\text{Component}$ -- the name of the component;

$\text{Table}$ -- the name of the table that corresponds to the component.

![Text](All_images/RDimage48.png)

For the multiplicative decomposition the following formula is used: $$\text{Component}_{d} = \frac{1}{n - d}\sum_{t = d+1}^{n}{|\frac{\text{Tabl}e_{t}}{\text{Table}_{t - d}} - 1|}$$.

(add image of result table for multiplictive model)

##### Relative contribution to the variance of the differences in the components of the original series

(homogenize titles: "variance") (one formula is enough)

Next, Table F2B of relative contributions of the different components to the differences (additive model) or percent changes (multiplicative model) in the original series is displayed. They express the relative importance of the changes in each component. Assuming that the components are independent, the following relation is valid:

$$O_{d}^{2} \approx C_{d}^{2} + S_{d}^{2} + I_{d}^{2} + P_{d}^{2} + {TD\& H}_{d}^{2}$$

In order to simplify the analysis, the approximation can be replaced by the following equation:

$$O_{d}^{*2} = C_{d}^{2} + S_{d}^{2} + I_{d}^{2} + P_{d}^{2} + {TD\& H}_{d}^{2}$$

The notation is the same as for Table F2A. The column $\text{Total}$ denotes total changes in the raw time series.

Data presented in Table F2B indicate the relative contribution of each component to the percent changes (differences) in the original series over each span, and are calculated as:

$\frac{I_{d}^{2}}{O_{d}^{*2}}$, $\frac{C_{d}^{2}}{O_{d}^{*2}}$, $\frac{S_{d}^{2}}{O_{d}^{*2}}$, $\frac{P_{d}^{2}}{O_{d}^{*2}}$ and $\frac{TD\& H_{d}^{2}}{O_{d}^{*2}}$ where: $O_{d}^{*2} = I_{d}^{2} + C_{d}^{2} + S_{d}^{2} + P_{d}^{2}{+ TD\& H}_{d}^{2}$.

The last column presents the *Ratio* calculated as: $100 \times\frac{O_{d}^{*2}}{O_{d}^{2}}$, which is an indicator of how well the approximation ${(O_{d}^{*})}^{2} \approx O_{d}^{2}$ holds.

![Text](All_images/RDimage49.png)

##### Average differences with regard to sign and standard deviation over indicated span

When an additive decomposition is used, Table F2C presents the average and standard deviation of changes calculated for each time lag $d$, taking into consideration the sign of the changes of the raw series and its components. In case of a multiplicative decomposition the respective table shows the average percent differences and related standard deviations.

![Text](All_images/RDimage50.png)

##### Average duration of run

Average duration of run is an average number of consecutive monthly (or quarterly) changes in the same direction (no change is counted as a change in the same direction as the preceding change). JDemetra+ displays this indicator for the seasonally adjusted series, for the trend and for the irregular component.

![Text](All_images/RDimage51.png)

##### I/C ratio over indicated span and global

The \$\frac{I}{C}\$ratios for each value of time lag $d$, presented in Table F2E, are computed on a basis of the data in Table F2A. Global IC is displayed below the table

![Text](All_images/RDimage52.png)

##### Relative contribution to the stationnary part of the variance in the original series

The relative contribution of components to the variance of the stationary part of the original series is calculated for the irregular component ($I$), trend made stationary ($C$), seasonal component ($S$) and calendar effects (TD&H).

The trend is made staionnary by by extracting a linear trend from the trend component presented in Table D12.

![Text](All_images/RDimage53.png)

##### Autocorrelations in the irregular

The last table shows the autocorrelogram of the irregular component from Table D13. In the case of multiplicative decomposition it is calculated for time lags between 1 and the number of periods per year +2 using the formula:

$$\text{Corr}_{k}I = \frac{\sum_{t = k + 1}^{N}{(I_{t} - 1)(I_{t - k} - 1)}}{\sum_{t = 1}^{N}{(I_{t} - 1)}^{2}}$$ where $N$ is number of observations in the time series and $k$ the lag.

For the additive decomposition the formula is: $$Corr_{k}I_{t} = \frac{\sum_{t = k + 1}^{N}{(I_{t} \times I_{t - k})}}{\sum_{t = 1}^{N}{(I_{t})}^{2}}$$

![Text](All_images/RDimage54.png)

##### Heteroskedasticity

Cochran test on equal variances within each period

The Cochran test is design to identify the heterogeneity of a series of variances. X-13-ARIMA-SEATS uses this test in the extreme value detection procedure to check if the irregular component is heteroskedastic. In this procedure the standard errors of the irregular component are used for an identification of extreme values. If the null hypothesis that for all the periods (months, quarters) the variances of the irregular component are identical is rejected, the standard errors will be computed separately for each period (in case the option *Calendarsigma*=**signif** has been selected).

##### Moving seasonality ratios (MSR)

For each $i^{\text{th}}$ month we will be looking at the mean annual changes for each component by calculating:

$${\overline{S}}_{i} = \frac{1}{N_{i} - 1}\sum_{t = 2}^{N_{i}}|S_{i,t} - S_{i,t - 1}|$$

and

$${\overline{I}}_{i} = \frac{1}{N_{i} - 1}\sum_{t = 2}^{N_{i}}| I_{i,t} - I_{i,t - 1}|$$,

where $N_{i}$ refers to the number of months $\text{i}$ in the data, and the moving seasonality ratio of month $i$:

$$MSR_{i} = \frac{\overline{I}_{i}}{\overline{S}_{i}}$$

The [Moving Seasonality Ratio (MSR)](M-X11-decomposition.qmd) is used to measure the amount of noise in the Seasonal-Irregular component. By studying these values, the user can [select for each period the seasonal filter](../reference-manual/sa-spec-X13.html#seasonal-filter-x11-seasonalma) that is the most suitable given the noisiness of the series.

### Output 3: final parameters

Relevant if parameters not set manually, or any parameters automatically selected by the software without having a fixed default value. (The rest of the parameters is set in the spec). To manually set those parameters and see all the fixed default values see Specifications / parameters section

Final trend filter : length of Henderson filter applied for final estimation (in the second part of the D step).

Final seasonal filer: length of Henderson filter applied for final estimation (in the second part of the D step).

### User-defined parameters

Here is described how to change default values or automatic choices.

##### General settings

-   **Mode**
    -   check if this option still works, if so add and edit instructions from old page)
    -   if not but button present : explain that the mode is determined in pre-adjustment (function)
-   **Seasonal component**
    -   check if still relevant, idem as above
    -   in v.2.3 if not ticked, S estimated but options on seasonal filter not available
-   **Forecasts horizon**

Length of the forecasts generated by the RegARIMA model - in months (positive values) - years (negative values) - if set to is set to 0, the X-11 procedure does not use any model-based forecasts but the original X-11 type forecasts for one year. - default value: -1, thus one year from the Arima model

-   **Backcasts horizon**

Length of the backcasts generated by the RegARIMA model - in months (positive values) - years (negative values) - default value: 0

##### Irregular correction

-   **LSigma**

    -   sets lower sigma (standard deviation) limit used to down-weight the extreme irregular values in the internal seasonal adjustment iterations, learn more here (LINK to M\_ chapter)
    -   values in $[0,Usigma]$
    -   default value is 1.5

-   **USigma**

    -   sets upper sigma (standard deviation)
    -   values in $[Lsigma,+\infty]$
    -   default value is 2.5

-   **Calendarsigma**

    -   allows to set different **LSigma** and **USigma** for each period
    -   values
        -   None (default)
        -   All: standard errors used for the extreme values detection and adjustment computed separately for each calendar month/quarter
        -   Signif: groups determined by cochran test (check)
        -   Sigmavec: set two customized groups of periods

-   **Excludeforecasts**

    -   ticked : forecasts and backcasts from the RegARIMA model not used in Irregular Correction
    -   unticked (default): forecasts and backcasts used

##### Seasonality extraction filters choice

Specifies which be used to estimate the seasonal factors for the entire series (link to relevant part in M chapter):

-   **Seasonal filter**

-   default value: *MSR* (Moving seasonality ratio), automatic choice of final seasonal filter (cf msr defintion and decison table: link ), initial filters are computed with $3\times 3$

-   choices : $3\times 1$, $3\times 3$, $3\times 5$, $3\times 9$, $3\times 15$ or Stable

-   "Stable" : constat factor for each calendar period (simple moving average of all $S+I$ values for each period)

User choices will be applied to all steps or only to final phase D step.

The seasonal filters can be selected for the entire series, or for a particular month or quarter.

-   **Details on seasonal filters**

Sets different seasonal filters by period in order to account for seasonal heteroskedasticity (link to M chapter)

-   default value: empty

##### Trend estimation filters

-   **Automatic Henderson filter** our user-defined

    -   default: length 13
    -   unticked: user defined length choice

-   **Henderson filter** length choice

    -   values: odd number in $[3,101]$
    -   default value: 13

Check: will user choice be applied to all steps or only to final phase D step

#### Parameter setting in GUI

Specification (general or particular to one series) image

All the parameters above can be set with the specification (link to general explanations) box

#### Parameter setting in R packages

extensive help on functions available in package help pages Rcode snippets

In R, to implement any param change, it is required to retrieve current spec, modify it and apply it again (see T R packages chapter for details). (specific link)

here example changing all the settings (just remove irrelevant changes)

Rjdemetra (v2) Edit : here static R code link to a "worked example" wih dynamic code ticked box in GUI corresponds to ...? in R

```{r eval=FALSE}
#Creating a modified specification, customizing all available X11 parameters

## SEATS Decomposition

(policy: what is readable in GUI should be explained, even if shortly, adding links to relevant method chapter)

SEATS (Signal Extraction for Arima Time Series) algorithm will decompose the linearized series, in level or in logarithm, using the Arima model fitted in the pre-treatment phase (link). The sections below describe - the specifications needed to run SEATS - the generated output - series - diagnostics - final parameters - the available user-defined parameters

### Default specifications

The default specifications for SEATS must be chosen at the starting of the SA processing. They are detailed in the [RegArima part](A-sa.qmd#Pre-treatment:%20Reg-ARIMA%20(or%20TRAMO)) Starting point for Tramo-Seats
