### Data frequencies 
The seasonal adjustment methods available in JDemetra+ aim to decompose
a time series into components and remove seasonal fluctuations from the
observed time series. The X-11 method considers monthly and quarterly
series while SEATS is able to decompose series with 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12
observations per year.

### X-13

X-13ARIMA is a seasonal adjustment program developed and supported
by the U.S. Census Bureau. It is based on the U.S. Census Bureau\'s
earlier X-11 program, the X-11-ARIMA program developed at Statistics
Canada, the X-12-ARIMA program developed by the U.S. Census Bureau, and
the SEATS program developed at the Banco de Espa√±a. The program is now
used by the U.S. Census Bureau for a seasonal adjustment of time series.
