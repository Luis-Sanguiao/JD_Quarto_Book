# RegArima (Tramo) Modelling {#a-reg-a .unnumbered}

## In this chapter

This chapter focuses on practical implementation of modelling of a time series (with arima residuals) .

The sections below will describe modelling features which can be used stand alone or as [pre-treatment](#sa-pre-t) (first step of [seasonal adjustment](#sa-overview)).

In-depth methodological explanations of the algorithms are covered in separated chapters, in the [Methods](#part-M) part.

## Modelling Algorithms

| Algorithm        | Access in GUI | Access in R (v2) | Access in R (v3) |
|------------------|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| Reg-Arima        | ✔️            | RJDemetra        |                  |
| Tramo            | ✔️            | RJDemetra        | rjd3tramoseats   |
| Extended Airline | ✔️ (v3 only)  | ✔                | rjd3highfreq     |
| STS              | ✖             | ✔                | rjd3sts          |


Steps to use Reg-Arima and Tramo in a pre-treatment context are described [here](#sa-pre-t). Options and outputs are the same as when modelling is done as pre-treatment or stand alone. Specification differ slightly and the possibility of saving parameters and generating output in the GUI is also different.

[Extended Airline Model](#a-sa-hf) allows to handle infra monthly series in a restricted reg-Arima framework.

[Strucural time series (STS)](#a-sa-bsm) allow another kind of modelling using state space framework.

## Practical Reg-Arima modelling 

For the user not needing seasonal adjustment, the sections below highlight the functions or steps allowing to perform reg-Arima (or Tramo) as a stand alone goal, outside of a seasonal adjustment process.
