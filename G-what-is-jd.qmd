## Seasonal adjustment algorithms

### Data frequencies

The seasonal adjustment methods available in JDemetra+ aim to decompose a time series into components and remove seasonal fluctuations from the observed time series. The X-11 method considers monthly and quarterly series while SEATS is able to decompose series with 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12 observations per year.

### X-13

X-13ARIMA is a seasonal adjustment program developed and supported by the U.S. Census Bureau. It is based on the U.S. Census Bureau's earlier X-11 program, the X-11-ARIMA program developed at Statistics Canada, the X-12-ARIMA program developed by the U.S. Census Bureau, and the SEATS program developed at the Banco de Espa√±a. The program is now used by the U.S. Census Bureau for a seasonal adjustment of time series.

### Tools

Jdemetra+ offers 3 kind of tools


### Underlying Statistical Methods

This part gives details about the underlying statistical methods to foster a more in-depth understanding of the algorithms.Those methods are described in the light and spirit of their use as buliding blocks of the algorithms presented above, not aiming at all at their comprehensive coverage. 

## How to use this book


audience: book targets the beginner as well as seasoned (pun 
moethodlogist.
The beginner is advised to use the quick start chapter as an etrey point, it's presneted like a decsion tree which will point directly to the the part it's useful to review.

the seasoned methodologist will benefit from the detailed chapter ad part strucutre to quickly find the needed information.
