# JDemetra+ Software {.unnumbered}

## Introduction

JDemetra+ is an open source software for **seasonal adjustment** and time series analysis. It has been officially recommended by Eurostat to the European Statistical System members since 2015. It is unique in its combination of very fast Java routines, a graphical user interface and a family of R packages. The graphical interface offers a structured and visual feedback, suitable for refined analysis and training. R tools allow the user to mix the capabilities of JDemetra+ with the versatility of the R world, be it for mathematical functions or data wrangling.

**Version 2.x and version 3**

Version 3.0 to be released by the summer of 2023, fills several critical gaps in the tool box of a time series analyst providing extended features for seasonal adjustment and trend estimation, including **high frequency data** and production tools.

## Structure of this book

This book is divided in 3 parts, allowing the user to access the resources from different perspectives.

### Algorithms

This part provides a step by step guidance for using of all the algorithms featured in JDemetra+:

-   [Seasonal Adjustment](A-sa.qmd)
-   [Seasonal Adjustment of high-frequency data](A-sa-hf.qmd)
-   [Reg-Arima modelling](A-sa.qmd)
-   [Outlier detection and external regressors](A-outlier-detection.qmd)
-   [Calendar correction](A-calendar-and-input.qmd)
-   [Benchmarking and temporal disaggregation](A-benchmarking.qmd)
-   [Trend-Cycle estimation](A-trend-cycle-estimation.qmd)
