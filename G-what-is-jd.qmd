## Seasonal adjustment algorithms

### Data frequencies

The seasonal adjustment methods available in JDemetra+ aim to decompose a time series into components and remove seasonal fluctuations from the observed time series. The X-11 method considers monthly and quarterly series while SEATS is able to decompose series with 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12 observations per year.

### X-13

X-13ARIMA is a seasonal adjustment program developed and supported by the U.S. Census Bureau. It is based on the U.S. Census Bureau's earlier X-11 program, the X-11-ARIMA program developed at Statistics Canada, the X-12-ARIMA program developed by the U.S. Census Bureau.

### Tools

JDemetra+ offers 3 kinds of tools
- A Graphical User Interface (GUI) which can be enhanced with plug-ins
- A set of R packages 
- A Cruncher for mass production in seasonal adjustment


### Underlying Statistical Methods

This part gives details about the underlying statistical methods to foster a more in-depth understanding of the algorithms.Those methods are described in the light and spirit of their use as building blocks of the algorithms presented above, not aiming at all at their comprehensive coverage. 

## How to use this book


### Audience 

This book targets the beginner as well as seasoned methodologist.
