### Step 2

The periodogram $$ I(\omega_j)$$ of $$ \mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{C}^n $$ is defined as the squared of the Fourier transform

$$
I(\omega_{j})=a_{j}^{2}=n^{-1}\left| \sum_{t=1}^{n}\mathbf{X_t} e^{-it\omega_j} \right|^{2},
$$

where the Fourier frequencies $$ \omega_{j} $$ are given by multiples of the fundamental frequency $$ \frac{2\pi}{n} $$:

$$
\omega_{j}= \frac{2\pi j}{n}, -\pi < \omega_{j} \leq \pi 
$$

An orthonormal basis in $$ \mathbb{R}^n $$:

$$ 
\left\{ e_0, ~~~~~~c_1, s_1, ~~~~~\ldots~~~~~\ , ~~~~c_{[(n-1)/2]}, s_{[(n-1)/2]}~~~~,~~~~~~ e_{n/2}  \right\},
$$ where $$ e_{n/2} $$ is excluded if $$ n $$ is odd,\
can be used to project the data and obtain the spectral decomposition

Thus, the periodogram is given by the projection coefficients and represents the contribution of the jth harmonic to the total sum of squares, as illustrated by Brockwell and Davis (1991):

In JDemetra+, the periodogram of $$ \mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^n $$ is computed for the standardized time series.

This scenario is designed for advanced users interested in an in-depth analysis of time series in the frequency domain using three spectral graphs. Those graphs can also be used as a complementary analysis for a better understanding of the results obtained with some of the tests described above.

Economic time series are usually presented in a time domain (X-axis). However, for analytical purposes it is convenient to convert the series to a frequency domain due to the fact that any stationary time series can be expressed as a combination of cosine (or sine) functions. These functions are characterized with different periods (amount of time to complete a full cycle) and amplitudes (maximum/minimum value during the cycle).

The tool used for the analysis of a time series in a frequency domain is called a spectrum. The peaks in the spectrum indicate the presence of cyclical movements with periodicity between two months and one year. A seasonal series should have peaks at the seasonal frequencies. Calendar adjusted data are not expected to have peak at with a calendar frequency.

The periodicity of the phenomenon at frequency *f* is $\frac{2\pi}{f}$. It means that for a monthly time series the seasonal frequencies \$\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{\pi}{3}, \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{2\pi}{3}, \frac{5\pi}{6}\$ and $\pi$ correspond to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 cycles per year. For example, the frequency $\frac{\pi}{3}$ corresponds to a periodicity of 6 months (2 cycles per year are completed). For the quarterly series there are two seasonal frequencies: $\frac{\pi}{2}$ (one cycle per year) and $\pi$ (two cycles per year). A peak at the zero frequency always corresponds to the trend component of the series. Seasonal frequencies are marked as grey vertical lines, while violet vertical lines represent the trading-days frequencies. The trading day frequency is 0.348 and derives from the fact that a daily component which repeats every seven days goes through 4.348 cycles in a month of average length 30.4375 days. It is therefore seen to advance 0.348 cycles per month when the data are obtained at twelve equally spaced times in 365.25 days (the average length of a year).

The interpretation of the spectral graph is rather straightforward. When the values of a spectral graph for low frequencies (i.e. one year and more) are large in relation to its other values it means that the long-term movements dominate in the series. When the values of a spectral graph for high frequencies (i.e. below one year) are large in relation to its other values it means that the series are rather trendless and contains a lot of noise. When the values of a spectral graph are distributed randomly around a constant without any visible peaks, then it is highly probable that the series is a random process. The presence of seasonality in a time series is manifested in a spectral graph by the peaks on the seasonal frequencies.



The estimator of the spectral density at frequency $$\lambda \in [0,\pi]$$ will be given by the assumption that the series will follow an AR(p) process with large $$p$$. The spectral density of such model, with an innovation variance $$ var(x_{t})=\sigma^2_x $$, is expressed as follows:

$$
 10\times log_{10} f_x(\lambda)=10\times log_{10} \frac{\sigma^2_x}{2\pi \left|\phi(e^{i\lambda}) \right|^2 }=10\times log_{10} \frac{\sigma^2_x}{2\pi \left|1-\sum_{k=1}^{p}\phi_k e^{i k \lambda}) \right|^2 }
$$

where $$ \phi_k $$ denotes the AR(k) coefficient, and $$ e^{-ik\lambda}=cos⁡(-ik\lambda)+i sin⁡(-ik\lambda)$$.

Soukup and Findely (1999) suggest the use of p=30, which in practice much larger than the order that would result from the AIC criterion. The minimum number of observations needed to compute the spectrum is set to *n=80* for monthly data (or *n=60*) for quarterly series. In turn, the maximum number of observations considered for the estimation is *n=121*. This choice offers enough resolution, being able to identify a maximum of 30 peaks in a plot of 61 frequencies: by choosing $$ \lambda_j=\pi j/60 $$,for $$ j=0,1,…,60 $$, we are able to calculate our density estimates at exact seasonal frequencies (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 cycles per year). Note that $$x$$ cycles per year can be converted into cycles per month by simply dividing by twelve, $$x/12$$, and to radians by applying the transformation $$2\pi(x/12)$$.

The traditional trading day frequency corresponding to 0.348 cycles per month is used in place of the closest frequency $$\pi j/60$$. Thus, we replace $$\pi 42/60$$ by $$\lambda_{42}=0.348\times 2 \pi = 2.1865 $$. The frequencies neighbouring $$ \lambda_{42}$$ are set to $$ \lambda_{41}= 2.1865-1/60 $$ and $$\lambda_{43}= 2.1865+1/60$$. The periodogram below illustrates the proximity of this trading day frequency $$\lambda_{42}$$ (red shade) and the frequency corresponding to 4 cycles per year $$\lambda_{40}=2.0944$$. This proximity is precisely what poses the identification problems: the AR spectrum boils down to a smoothed version of the periodogram and the contribution of the of the trading day frequency may be obscured by the leakage resulting from the potential seasonal peak at $$\lambda_{40}$$, and vice-versa.

JDemetra+ allows the user to modify the number of lags of this estimator and to change the number of observations used to determine the AR parameters. These two options can improve the resolution of this estimator.
